﻿ Intro to give background information and preliminary knowledge. Methods to methodically show how to replicate the experiment. Results to show what happened during the experiment. And discussion validation of what happened and maybe even why it happened.  Ideation and brainstorming. You cannot have a solution without this. Arguably equal is making the proper constraints to ensure you deliver a legitimate solution that solves the problem.  "They are all positive and encouraging. Maybe we need more time actually at Cirrus to help get thing done. Also  Alex is no longer our contact which is a slight inconvenience."  I start by defining the problem and creating a list of constraints and a list of requirements. Then I research solutions that already exist and how others deal with the problem. I apply existing fundamental principles/technology to create a solution. I create a prototype. Then improve the solution. Profit?
﻿ I feel like the block is going buy really fast and that I have a lot of work left to do in each competency. I think that I am anxious to graduate which makes things difficult.  "Dynamic systems  it's a class that is unorganized and talks about many different topics and I am unsure of what to do for a DLA. Some of our conversations relate to topics I know nothing about which makes it difficult sometimes."
﻿ "Our schedules are very busy  so we don't get to work together very often. Also  we don't have as much motivation when at IRE."  We should go to Cirrus more often. We should also have times set aside where the team can work together while being on the same room.
﻿ Listening and actually considering what the others are saying and take it all into account. Giving positive feedback is important to help everyone improve. Being objective and factual is always important when communicating.  "My biggest rule is to not judge someone right away. Give everyone a chance. Try to learn something from everyone. Judge people based on their actions  and character."  "The key characteristics for leadership are confidence  conflict management  hard work ethic  lead by example  knowledge in the subject area  communication  the ability to motivate."  "I think the biggest way mindfulness has affected me is by thinking of how the actions of everyone on the team affect each other. I have also been very mindful of how my actions really affect me. I have been very aware of doing things that are good for my health  and my happiness  while trying to maintain my commitments to school and my teammates. To me mindfulness is extremely important. I think far too many people are unaware of what their actions do. Day after day people develop routines that are ultimately not healthy. They eat poorly  neglect their family  do things against their values  and so on. I try to be aware of how my actions impact me and those around me. I try to stay true to my mission statement which was created at the beginning of the semester. (This is something that I feel IRE should look at more often and to me is something very valuable) “My personal mission statement is to pursue a life of self-fulfillment where I can blur the lines between work and play  to hold a high moral standard of only bringing utility and never harm to another individual. To think and act in an objective manner and to constantly improve myself and those around me.” I think I practice mindfulness. I am constantly setting goals and tracking them making sure I am making progress. If I don't work on my goals every day  I feel terrible for not making progress. However  I would definitely like spend more time reflecting and relaxing  almost brainstorm on what my next steps are. I think I have been getting better in the aspect of how my actions affect others  and. It is important to me that I generate a positive experience for the people I interact with."

﻿ "Lifelong learning is always taking the opportunity to listen to others  attend seminars  read  and constantly improve one's skills and knowledge. To seek information in order to increase earning potential  happiness  versatility  and so on. Lifelong learning is understanding that new things are always being developed and there is always more to learn on a subject. To keep an open mind and to reflect on experiences is how to be a great lifelong learner."  "To me self-directed learning is having the ability to know what resources are available to you  the internet has a plethora of articles and videos written by many types of individuals on every subject. Libraries have FREE access to books written by experts dedicated to the field or subject and can date back many years up to present day. People  the people around us can guide us and help us achieve lifelong learning  we just must be willing to ask and listen."  "In school  I was a team leader for an entire semester and took a class on project management. For work I lead by example setting a high standard both in outdoor ethics and in safety. I also have been learning about team dynamics  how to deal with people in an office setting and in a factory setting."  "We have to solve problems and deal with issues that are happening in our cities  and in our countries  really on a global scale. Especially now with issues such as carbon emission  bad mining practices  international trade  it’s all relevant to engineers  in fact engineers are the ones dealing with these issues."
 Either written down in a journal or typed up in a computer program such as excel. "Write ups help track progress or recall from past experiments  and they can be used to verify that an outcome had happened when the next time that the same experiment would have been run came out differently."   "I think that understanding the problem would be the most important part to start the problem off with. I think that if you dont know what you are doing with a problem  it is very easy to get confused. Also staying with the scope and avoiding scope creep is another important part. Things can get very carried away very fast and its important to understand what you are doing  and it is important to stay on task with the project or problem at hand."   "Our client has been phenomenal  they have been able to point us in the right direction without giving too much away and they havent been giving us without any direction. For me  I feel like these interactions will be able to provide us with very valuable learning skills."   "I really like the IRE design wheel for a design process  so that is the most common process that I use when I go about solving an open-ended problem. I start with the problem definition and then I go through design objectives  learning objectives  Planning  Idea generation and selection  modeling and testing  and design evaluation  and then I go through each category as many times as I feel necessary for the successful completion of the project."
 "Last semester  I felt more confident in the progress that I had completed  however  this year is different because I think that the calc class that I took this semester  is putting me back a little bit. I did have comps banked  but the class that Im taking is 4 credits and 9 credits go straight to seminar  design  and professionalism  out of the 18 that are allotted  I can only take 5 comps this entire semester. That is only 2 one block and 3 the next block and that puts me behind a couple of comps."   "Entrepreneurial. There are a lot of videos to watch and a lot of writing to go along with it  and I can not find the right time to absorb all that I am doing."
 "I think that our team needs to communicate a little more to each other to state how their progress has been on the tasks that they are doing  I feel that that trait is leveling the amount of work that we are actually able to take out of this project."    I would start by maybe having just a short discussion maybe like 5-10 minutes of where we are in the tasks that have been assigned to us. That way we can gauge our progress more effectively while moving forward.   "I definitely think that there is room for improvement. It has been pretty chaotic these past few weeks  especially since there is a major deadline/milestone coming up with having to send out a new fan design. I think our team just needs to briefly take a step back to take a breath and compose ourselves before digging into the rest of the project."   That has been how this project has been getting completed. I think that the individual work that has been getting done has been doing a great job with completing the tasks that needed to be completed.
 Getting a message across effectively. Learning to communicate effectively and efficiently Active Listening  ? Thinking before speaking.    "Role model material  someone who can be trusted  valued  respected."   "My personal mission statement is to make ethical decisions to the best of my ability. I understand that everyone has different views as to what they deem ethical  and it is going to be up to me to decide how I am going to act around that. I believe that making ethical choices comes down to make or break situations and it is important to understand all sides of the issue or story to get all of the facts straight before acting upon a gut feeling."  "Ethical decisions are being made every day and it is going to be crucial to society that the right decisions are made because ethical decisions affect everyone including yourself  whether it be a positive or negative impact."   "I think that mindfulness gives a team a more aware approach to the project  being mindful is very beneficial in that the team would be better at approaching a task from all sides of a perspective and choose the right way to get that task done. "
 Going over the jobs package really helps a person prep a person prepare for the actual interview process.   "By getting things done and being supportive to people who may need it  also by not taking things for granted and appreciating what there is to offer."
"I know that with the knowledge that I gain from all the experience  I will be able to go into a job interview at any step of the way confidently."  "Lifelong learning means that even after you are done with school  you are still learning. It can be learning on the job  learning a new skill  or even learning a new life lesson from an experience you had. I believe that everyone is a lifelong learner  but in their own way "  "Self-directed learning  I think  will really benefit my lifelong learning. I think it counts as the first step to lifelong learning because more than likely everything you do after graduation is going to count as lifelong learning."  I am really working on building my work ethic and being able to create inclusive environments.  "By knowing what is going on throughout the world you can make paces to make it a better place. Say that you are reading about a third world country that is in need of fresh water but the only clean water sources is 1 mile away  you could design a quicker way to get the water to them so they dont have to walk or carry it a mile."  "By either faking it till you make it  or by actually practicing showing traits of empathy and care. It might be that you have to picture yourself in that other persons shoes for you to be able to understand where that person is coming from."
﻿ "The results would be communicated in a final report that explains  in detail  every part of the experiment and results.  The experiment should be repeatable by others using the same methods described in the report.  This should give similar results  proving the hypothesis and experiment."  "Defining the problem is the most important. It is also necessary to review the requirements from time to time to make sure the progress is staying on track with solving the problem. Correctly defining the problem is the most important though. If the problem is incorrectly understood  the entire process is a waste of time and resources. The problem solution may be different than the initially proposed or anticipated outcome  but the problem solution has to solve the original problem."  "I think that the client for the deep dive is my subconscious. I cannot lie to my subconscious  and right now  my subconscious is worried that the rest of my memory is going to be a disappointment. In the time left to prepare  I will do what I can to improve my confidence."  "Pick a problem; Define what the problem is  and then define the requirements involved in the problems; List constraints and objectives; Figure out what fundamental principles apply; Detail a plan for progressing through the problem  maybe include desired outcomes; Brainstorm the process for solving the problem  keeping the previous requirements in mind; Develop a decision matrix or some method for determining the best solution to investigate. Work through the problem and refer to the constraints and requirements. Keep it realistic. Evaluate the solution to make sure the problem's question was met. Make sure that the solution fits all the rules that were determined at the beginning of the evaluation."
﻿ Good.  "The rest of my work is different than usual competency work. It's all fine  but I have a lot to do. The block is going fast  and I have many things to learn these next two weeks. I don't have a specific subject that is the worst. I just have a lot of material to understand in a short time."
﻿ "Sometimes I would rather study more on my own. This gets interrupted in our office. I don't want to have to say something about how I get distracted. I would rather just go to a different  secluded study space."  "I think we should try to figure out if there is anything that is helping or hindering our individual performance. I don't know if I can say what would help the others. I need to spend time studying alone  so that group prep is more valuable."  "I just started on the team  so I am not the best judge of the completeness of the project. I am working to get up to speed on the project so that I can make a good contribution to its completion. The team seems to have a lot done  but the normal mid-semester panic seems to be showing up. I think the direction is a little unclear for how to get everything accomplished. It might be that the details of what we are planning to accomplish may be misunderstood. Again  I just started so I know that I have a lot to figure out so that I clearly understand what we are doing. I can figure it out  I just need a bit of time."  "The team was very large. 13 people. This did not mean that the amount of work was reduced. This meant that the output of the team could be substantial. The amount of work we completed was great  but each person worked very hard to contribute to the success of the project."
﻿ "Without looking this up on Google  this will be an attempt to recall previous learning: (a) Listen before talking. I know someone has to start the conversations  but honestly listen when others are talking. Many people struggle the most with this basic principle. This applies to words and body language from others. (b) Think before talking. To keep the communication productive  it helps to have an idea of the topics the learning conversation or meeting will cover. Spend a little time briefing yourself by looking at the plan  agenda  notes  or whatever info may help with keeping the discussion productive. Questions during conversations are always welcome  but blatant disregard for other people's time is unprofessional. (c) Take turns taking notes. Everyone should take notes during meetings  but the official notes for a meeting should not be the responsibility of only one person. It helps to have a predetermined order for rotation of this responsibility."  "Defining the problem is the most important. It is also necessary to review the requirements from time to time to make sure the progress is staying on track with solving the problem. Correctly defining the problem is the most important though. If the problem is incorrectly understood  the entire process is a waste of time and resources. The problem solution may be different than the initially proposed or anticipated outcome  but the problem solution has to solve the original problem."  "I'm going to continue to try to think of how I would like to be treated. I will try to remember how I could have been fairer in past experiences. I work hard to not be biased  but I know that everyone can make mistakes. I make so many mistakes. Everyone can also improve. I will continue to try to improve."  "Listening  understanding  reflection  and being a good example.  The best leaders lead by example."  "Every person must be treated with respect and with fairness. People must be allowed to share their ideas and knowledge. People can have differing opinions  and ethics involves listening to their opinions and contemplating their reasons. The fundamentals of ethics are listening  understanding  fair treatment  and limiting judgement. This requires one to question one's personal beliefs. Selfishness is never allowed. Knowing how one's goals  words  actions  and intentions affect others is primary to understanding ethics."
﻿ "I passed the FE exam. It was a tough test  but it really changed how I think. I am applying engineering concepts to everything. I had previously tried to think about engineering fundamentals and their applications in everyday actions  but that test rewired my brain. I'm much more confident in my abilities and understanding of how fundamental principles apply to so many daily functions."
 "Im looking for real jobs right now. Im graduating in May  and I need a job. The jobs package was great practice to improve the experience. I will try to remember to have confidence in myself when I interview. And I will tailor the resume and cover letter to each job I apply to."  This involves always looking for ways to improve your understanding about topics. Lifelong learning includes learning for work and home life. It includes community knowledge too. The concept of lifelong learning involves having an interest in growing your knowledge.  "Most learning is self-directed. Seminars and classes are wonderful ways to learn  but the majority of learning is self-directed. It can be as simple as using Google  but it takes a willingness and interest to keep your mind sharp and growing."  I try to reflect about what I have done and what could have gone better. I try to listen to people I am working with. I try to understand the abilities of leaders that I observe.  "Contemporary issues involve safety  economics  technological development  popularity  and any person or issue that could be affected by the work I may do. Professional engineering always has to function ethically. Ethical decisions and designs have contemporary issue knowledge as part of their requirements. An example would be environmental impact. The rules change  but environmental impact of a product is part of ethical design and contemporary issue cognizance."
﻿ "The results from an experiment should be reported clearly and concisely. It is important for the information to be clear and concise because the results will be communicated to others that may be interested in the results or in recreating the experiment eventually. The results should also be technical so that they maintain their validity. They should be reported within a well written document  that includes all the important facts and details from the experiment. It will also be important to include any relevant graphs or charts."  "In my opinion the team monitoring is the most important aspect of the design process  however this isn’t really a step in the process. Monitoring the team is important because without a smooth flowing team  it is almost impossible for the project to be a full success. If each member of the team is happy and working hard towards the result  then the team will work seamlessly together. However  if I had to select the most important step within the process  I’d select developing objectives. This step is very important because it happens towards the beginning of the process and sets the foundation for the rest of the project. This is also a very hard step to jump over or quickly move through because it does require working with the client and ensuring that everyone understands what we want this project to look like in the end."  "The communication with our client has been minimal. We have not had a need to interact with them much  other than during the scoping meeting. The team intends to send the BOM to the client soon and will be asking for clarification about the budget. There has been a little confusion regarding the budget."  "For some reason  I imagine open-ended problems to be different in industry then they are here at IRE. I feel that in industry we will have more direction of where to go with a problem rather than a complete blank canvas. It is my perceptive that there will be others that have more experience than me and are able to direct me the right way. However  my personal model includes following the IRE design wheel. The design wheel is a good way to have an organized approach to an open-ended problem. I will follow through the steps of this process to help generate ideas to move forward with."
﻿ "As always  the block is flying by  and I am realizing that I’m only picking up small amounts of information from my technical competencies. The information that I am getting from the competencies seems relevant and interesting. Although  the most of my technical learning has been coming from my project thus far. There is so much to learn about it."  "Material science is proving to be my most challenging competency this block. It is extremely interesting information  but I can tell that learning only one credit means we are skimming over a lot of details. The other reason this competency is not going as well is because Andy is assigning a lot of homework. For the answers to the homework  we are supposed to use online resources  the problem with the online resources is that some of the information has not been accurate. Also  with so much homework  Andy has fallen behind returning homework to us and so I’m not sure where I stand grade wise in that class. It is my responsibility to find him and ask him for my grade though  so I will make that a goal to do before he leaves next week."
﻿  "There are two things that are hindering the team’s success  in my opinion. The first thing is our lack of utilizing our design tools. We have begun to create decision matrices to assist with our selection  but no one really takes the time to input the information into the matrices. It is my belief that if we all became better at using these  we would be able to make clear selections and have tools to show our panel. We want to be able to communicate effectively to others how we made our selections. The second thing that is hindering our team’s success and which is out of our realm of control  are the number of deliverables for the project this semester. Since there are so many deliverables  we are constantly working on one or another. We have also run into the issue of not receiving timely feedback from the teachers. This prevents us from moving forward and deliverables are beginning to stack up! Even with how organized we are with our documents; they still take up an immense amount of time each week; time that could be spent working on the actual project."  "Receiving rubrics for the deliverables before we begin them would be immensely helpful. Not having a rubric before starting a document leaves us unknowing of what the faculty wants in that document. The first two documents that we have worked on thus far  had horrible remarks from the first revision. Hopefully  we will be able to get a little closer to what they are requesting on the second revisions."  "I feel that we are at a good place for where we are in the semester! Being at the halfway point aligns well with being half way through the semester. I still believe that this has been the most productive team that I have yet to work on  at IRE. Our 1/x is right where it should be. Everyone seems to be contributing their fair share and we are being very successful. I look forward to Turbo Week because I know that as a team  we will fully utilize it. I hope that after Turbo Week we will be ahead of where we would like to be. I believe that this is possible for our team  it will just require a ton of devotion during Turbo Week. We also have a good idea of what we want to accomplish  so I will push for us to accomplish these tasks as early on as possible so that we have more time for team bonding activities."   "My personal contribution to the project was in the way of management  documentation support  and some technical support. It had been a goal of mine to improve my leadership skills and I believe that they did improve throughout the semester. My support with documentation was important as well because it turns out that document writing is a skill and its one that I believe I poses. I was able to apply my writing skills and help improve the quality of our documents. And finally  I tried to do some technical work support which included working with the programming of the Arduinos  working in the lab  and assisting with the wireless communication."
﻿ "One of the important aspects of interpersonal communication is showing that you are listening with your body language. The other person will be able to pick up on your body language ques while they are talking. They will either feel respected and know that you are listening  or they will sense that you are not listening  which may offend the other person. Another important aspect is understanding the audience you are talking to  then adapting your phrasing to that group. If you are discussing a technical topic but are not talking with others that will understand your technical jargon; you must adapt to them and use different language. Using voice inflections will also be useful when communicating. The different pitches of your voice will convey different stories to others. This is especially important while having a phone conversation. The other person will not be able to read your body language  however they will be able to pick up on your different pitches in your voice."  "Seeing as unconscious biases are unconscious  I will need to first address what the biases are. Fortunately  Chris sent out a link to a site in which you can take tests to discover what your biases might be. I have taken a couple of the tests but there are many more to take. Once  I have identified my biases then I will be able to consciously address them. Being conscious of the biases will allow me to focus on them and address them as soon as I’m exhibiting them. I believe being aware of them will be the most important step to minimizing mine."  "One of the most important elements of leadership is having good communication skills. Communication is such a huge part of being a successful leader because how is a person supposed to effectively lead if they can’t communicate information to those that they are leading. Poor leadership will leave others confused and not understanding what it is that they are supposed to do. Another skill of a leader is to have empathy for others. There are times when things happen to someone  and they have no control over the situation. It is important as a leader to empathize and try to place yourself in the shoes of the other person. At least trying to understand what the other person is going through will allow the leader to be more effective. A few other essential elements to leadership include a leader to be flexible and willing to change plans if the team needs to make changes. Have honesty  leading by example will help the whole team thrive. And consistency by the leader will help those that are being led understand what their roles are and what is needed/expected of them."  "Ethics are very important to engineers which is why we have a code of ethics. I believe all engineers should be held to this higher standard of ethics. Following these codes might seem very simple  but ethics is not usually a black and white situation. There are many areas of gray that must be navigated. For myself  I find that following my gut is often the best way to act ethically. Fortunately for me  my gut reaction to situations is usually a very ethical one. Daily  I try to approach situations with an open mind. I believe that having an open mind will allow me to make ethical decisions. Another useful tool to become better within ethical situations is to self-reflect on any situation after it occurs. Doing this daily will provide me with experiences and understanding of what the situation was  and how I handled it. The reflecting will be useful to become better with making ethical decisions in the future."  "Being mindful of the other team members allows us to all get more done because we aren’t interrupting each other with unnecessary tidbits of information. Part of being mindful of the others is that they are all trying to get their own work done  so it is rather rude to interrupt them while they are trying to get work done. During T’s IRE Talk  she shared that it takes 4 minutes on average for a person to get refocused on a task after being interrupted. I try to think before I interrupt others and think to myself if what I needed to say was worth interrupting them. Also  being mindful of the other feelings is useful for minimizing conflicts. After a semester long project  I feel that I’m able to read when someone is having a bad day. It is important to be aware of their moods so that I can direct them accordingly and hopefully not make their day worse."
﻿ Listening to Claire’s presentation about applying for jobs.  "A great way to practice happiness is to minimize the number of negative feelings that happen throughout the day and removing the constant thinking and talking about those negative feelings. It would be best to stop talking or thinking about things that are frustrating and instead  focus energy on the positive things. The more positive we stay  the happier we will be."
﻿ "The jobs package is highly beneficial because we receive a lot of good feedback that we can use. Although the interviews are not necessarily an accurate representation of the interviews I’ve had in the “real world”  I still believe that they help build confidence. I also feel like it is a great way to prepare for interviews because we take the time to think of stories and answers to common questions."  "This is the act of continually learning new things and experiencing new experiences. A person can learn from working with their hands-on things that they have never done before  or from reading from a book or online resources  or they can learn from new experiences. All three of these activities must be done continually throughout life and a person must take an active role in the learning as it is happening."  "Self-directed learning requires a person to be 100% accountable for their own learning. A person will get whatever they put into something  so if something is very important to learn  it will be important to put in the same amount of energy to learn the new material. I believe that keeping a copy of the self-directed learner diagram could be highly beneficial as I move through my career. It will remind me to reflect and practice retention activities. Being a self-directed learner will also allow me to continually advance with my company. Knowledge is power  the more knowledgeable I become within my position  the larger my responsibilities will be with that organization."  "To help increase my leadership skills I have been doing small personal checks on myself. The largest skill that I have been working to enhance is being patient with others. Before returning to school  I would become irritated and impatient with others quickly. I have slowly been developing my leadership skills since returning to school and it seems that one of the most important things is to be patient. Having patience allows me to take time to think about how I should react before reacting and to understand the situation better before coming to any conclusions. So  to do this  I will catch myself occasionally when I’m about to be sassy and I take a deep breath and change my attitude. The thing that bothers me most is that I become quickly irritated by others when they interrupt me while I’m working. I think about the fact that she shared during her IRE talk  that it takes 4 minutes for a person to get refocused after being interrupted. I try to be aware of this when I interrupt others and I try to remind myself that not everyone else does the same thing. So  I will be continually interrupted  and it will be my responsibility to be understanding that others may not consider the 4 minutes refocus time like I do."  "As an engineer it will be important to be up to date with current events and topics that are happening. Being current on these topics is important to engineers because it is expected that we are educated and understanding of things that are happening around us. We must be able to consider current issues while working  to be sure that we are doing what is best for our clients."  One great way of increasing my capacity to empathize and care is to read books about self-development. Every self-development book that I have read has helped me to become a slightly better person. I would like to read more of these books once I have more time to read. I also believe that it is important to surround yourself with people that also have these qualities and want to continually improve them. Surrounding myself with other like-minded people will help me to change my mind set as well.
﻿ The raw data should be compiled in a computer program like excel. The report should inform what principles to use and why it was needed.  Designing is closely followed by testing in my opinion. For without designing there won't be a product and in that as engineers if we can’t design then our jobs are useless. Testing is additionally important because if you encounter problems then you have to change our design testing is the only thing that will definitely show that you have to change.  The client is every enthusiastic for the project and we are striving to help them to the best of our abilities.  One look at the problem and look for general problem that is closes enough to it then adapt it to your circumstances if there isn’t a general solution then take into consideration making a mind map with possible solutions and every yes or no answer branch off into a new bubble.
﻿ "There seems to be a difference in what is learned in lower division and in upper for example with physics one you would learn newton's second law in contrast with entrepreneurship there is a change of mindset so it hard to prove that I have progressed but when my friends talk  I usually can hold my own so I’m learning but it is slow indeed. "  "That would be with instrumentation I don’t know what I’m supposed to be learning and there doesn't seem to be a direction for the class rather than the instructor just make it up as he goes most likely I’m not noticing the direction  but I am learning.  "
﻿   It does not. Something that have slowed us down are sickness of one of our teammates but that can be helped.  Just keep on doing what we are doing right now and if a lack of motivation starts to happen quickly look at what is happening and resolve the problem.  We are currently at 45% if the testing that we are conducting goes well we will be near 75% done as the testing will prove our hypostasis or make us reconsider what we have chosen.  T and B did an amazing job with all of the documents. B found the MAP sensor and made all of the mounting brackets.
﻿ Working with other people if you don’t like working with people then you will have a hard time; Being respectful; Responsive to people.  By actively trying to stop seeing people for their differences rather just see them as people regardless of what they are.  "First and foremost is being able to read a situation and act accordingly. Knowing when to take a step back and avoid micromanaging your people. Knowing you are not the most knowledgeable person in the team and when you have a content experts consult him/her. Knowing that you are not going to get along with everyone  but you must make sure that the team still runs smoothly."  This can be summed up in a single phrase and that is do the right thing. I believe that by now if you aren’t an ethical person by now there is a serious problem. And the likelihood of you changing is next to impossible. Not saying that it does not happen but most likely not going to happen. I don’t believe that there is a reason for making some kind of lengthy message about your personal code of ethics there are something you keep in your heart whether it is through your faith or through something else.  First off never trust Wikipedia. Secondly you must take into consideration everything that is going on in your environment and this of course applies to what is going on in the team. One thing that I have personal experience with is being mindful of what others are thinking about or how they might interpret what you say.
﻿ Nothing to report.  "I like my electrical classes and not much of a fan of the mechanical classes  but I enjoy figuring out complex problems."
﻿ Keep improving and take all feedback with a grain of salt.  "When I hear lifelong learning the first thing that comes to mind is being an engineering when you get out of school you are not going to know everything  but we will have to learn on demand. Additionally  we often think that once you are out of school you stop learning but this isn’t true learning is lifelong."  I have been on the path of self-directed learning for quite a while most recently I have been teaching myself how the HC12 works the reason for this is no one else knows much about it and this is something that I believe that I will encounter in my job as an engineer.  The one that I’m working on right now is just trusting other abilities as I have been burned before and it is hard to believe that someone has your back. Don’t get me wrong my team is awesome.  This would relate to my career because if there's going to be a demand for certain products in the near future.   Try not to talk so much and be more reflective on what I say.
﻿ "The experimental results should be reported through written documentation and also in a visual representation such as a graph. The results should not be skewed for any reason and should be reported as found. There might be outliers in the data that varies quite a bit from the rest of the data. It is important to keep this outlier in the report as it serves as the real data that was interpreted through experimentation  but there should be an explanation for why it occurred in the discussions section. The results will typically go near the end of the report as a discussion should immediately follow the results portion."
﻿ "I feel great about the progress I am making in Material Science and all of my Advanced FE competencies. There are many reasons why the progress is going so well  but there are also a couple of things that I still need to overcome. I will continue to work hard to overcome all of the obstacles that are in the way of passing the FE exam."  "I think the competency that could use the most improvement is Material Science. There’s certainly not a lack of effort  but I think these next two weeks will really tie everything together. I feel like I have learned a lot of new individual concepts  but I am still trying to see the bigger picture in how they all relate to each other. The reason I know they all relate is because they are all a part of the material paradigm which connects everything to characterize each material. Andy informed us that the connections will begin to come here in the next 1-2 weeks as we learn how they all tie together. This will make the rest of the competency move along more smoothly."

﻿ "The only way to minimize my own unconscious biases is to first identify them. This is very difficult to do on my own  so asking others to join me in this professional growth is essential. It could work much like a buddy system where each person can point out when they experience the other acting on a potential unconscious bias. This could be done in any type of environment at work and even at home. Kaitlyn and I have worked on this in the past."  It is very important that everyone has a chance to speak their minds and also listen to what others have to say. Another thing that is very important is to limit those who are used to talking a lot so they can learn to summarize what they want to say in a shorter period of time instead of rambling on.
﻿ "I would like to reflect on how well I did at managing my emotions throughout studying for and throughout actually taking the FE exam. I learned how important it is to manage my own emotions as I am going through anything in life. This big exam was a great way to see how well I am doing at managing my own emotions. The first step is simply taking care of myself. This has a couple of subcategories that are worth noting. I focused on eating well  sleeping well  and not having any alcohol. Eating well takes a bit of planning and isn’t as easy as it sounds. It actually takes careful planning and working with someone else to hold each other accountable. Sleeping well is done by making sure I am getting 8 hours of sleep each night and trying not to stay up past 10pm every night. Cutting out any alcohol is pretty self-explanatory and is easy for me to do but may be difficult for others. Two things that work well for me when trying to maintain a clear mind are working out and listening to comforting music. I drive quite a bit on the weekends as Kaitlyn and I go back to Grand Rapids  and I tend to drive even more due to officiating hockey. This gives me time to clear my mind if I allow myself to do so. If I listen to music that is distracting  I tend not to relax while driving. For me  it’s the Christian radio station that plays relaxing music. To others  it may strictly be country or softer pop music. It’s different for everybody  but recognizing what music is relaxing can play a key role in managing emotion. The last thing that worked well for managing my emotions was a gratitude journal. This was the first time I had started a journal like this  and it was a major success. It’s one thing to just think about the people and things in life that I am grateful/thankful for  but it’s another to actually write it down on paper. Not only that  but including the details for the reasons why I am grateful requires a lot of thought. As time progresses  I am forced to think much harder about things that I am grateful. Having more gratitude towards people and things in general has given me a whole new perspective on everyday encounters and tasks."
﻿ "The actions that need to be taken in order to become more efficient in my learning revolves around managing my emotions. I was able to manage my emotions and take care of myself weeks prior to taking the exam  and I have never felt so confident in my abilities as an engineer before. It made all of the work I put in worth the time by managing my emotions and feeling grateful for everything I have in life. It makes me want the end goal more and more which makes the work I put in more productive  thus increasing efficiency."   I will continue to watch my videos before having any interview in the future. It really helps to create talking points that I may have forgotten over the few months or years. I will continue to look over all of my feedback over the years that I keep in my professional development plan binder. I really enjoy having this kind of documentation at my disposal for future reference. I love having four iterations of job package experience.
 Recorded via videotape for any trials that can be used for future modified trials.  Notebook for random thoughts on how things ran Predetermined table or chart to fill out on intervals   "Research. This area is the only way you can learn what you don't know about the process. Once you learn the process and components  then you can go ask for more advice from the technicians or instrumentations personnel working. Still  research is the most important because you will always be learning even if it's the stage of finding solutions."    Fine. There seems to be two viewpoints management and Instrumentation. "Some think they have the information  others don�t. While others know where the information is  but we haven�t asked that one person yet."
  Material Science and Heat Transfer with Andy is a blast. I feel very confident in my understanding with all the principles taught thus far. "My PBL credit is not where I want it. As it is already the 4th week and we have yet to have a learning period towards the Project. I have hit the point that I am going to lead it with the team  and if they don't like it they can wait for someone else. But I want to learn something now and will relate it back to last semester's PBL as it is very close- just a different topic  under the same principle."   PBL is falling short of expectations due to how much we have done this first block. "Mechanisms havent even been attempted  and I might have to take an incomplete. Just havent found any time related to my project or own personal desires to want to learn it."
 "I feel that at times  when one tries to limit these said petpeevs  it's done in a snide remark tone. As if they are only saving face of letting them know  but not attempting to work around it just dive through it."   "Really only time  relationships build over time. Good or bad  we will grow more on each other. And hopefully  we see it as sincere when one brings up a problem and are mindful of them."   "I think this estimate is on the pessimistic side. As we are further than we think. We are a little hesitant on the pressure of the condenser  thus we haven't finalized our heat balance. After talking with faculty about this  I think we will just stick with one pressure and go from there. If we do this heat balance in Excel  a simple change of a cell will be the only thing that needs to change."
 Raising your own believes and concerns. Give everyone else the same chance to raise their own beliefs and concerns "Lastly  gives a time for reflection on who has the better choice"   ? "Occasionally  ask if it's rational to think the way I have to another." And let people know may just be me venting. It's very rare you see me passive aggressively attack someone   Having a vision for the team to look towards.   "I try to be as optimistic as possible with any situation. Regardless of how short the deadline line is and how much work still has yet to be done. To me  it makes no sense to add to everyone elses stress levels by restating in my voice what everyone else has. When it comes to having to bear the bad news  I do my best to be respectful of how they take it. I do my best to say it and if necessary to figure out a plan of attack with them  or those involved before leaving on a bad foot. " "Those that are close understand this  as I always wish safe travels or nights when leaving my presence. My other greatest attribute is being very patient with others. Depending on the level of crap they dish out to me or others  determines how much I refrain from confronting. Since I seldomly do this  that's why when I do confrontthem  9 times out of 10  they get their shit together."
 "IEEE Conference  as I was able to go to another school and attend their project presentations. I got to connect with the other IRE students that went with  more so than my own project team because we spent time together outside of doing schoolwork"
"Tailor it to the company that I am applying for  a have questions that are I know I got it  or they need longer to think."
 Results from an experiment can be reported many ways. The most common way is graphs or tables. The results can be compiled over time and compared between control groups and experimental groups. The results should be a finalized report when finished.   The most important steps to me are the problem definition and the idea generation and selection phase. By being able to successfully distinguish your scope more time can be spent in the idea generation phase which is where there is a lot of time spent to make sure all options are considered.   Interactions with our client are successful. Most of our questions get answered by after he talks to other resources at the airport. We have documented questions and the answers to those questions in a list on the Drive.
 "Keeping on top of it but it is tough. The challenge is definitely there and I cant even think about the things that still need to get done that I havent got a chance to start. One day at a time  one assignment at a time."   AC Circuits because of my lack of confidence in my learning and the challenging material
 Things get confusing when documents are made and put on the Drive to without notice. Making sure to check the Drive and its folders is something I can improve on personally to remain up to date. We can all do a better job at making sure to get all of our team members feedback on documents and other project tasks before they are completed.   I think our team can improve by assigning tasks to people not based off of their experience level alone but also based off people wanting to do things they currently don't have the skills at doing. I feel by integrating the new generations students more with the old generation students on a task that one or both of the students might not be good at we can learn and improve team communication.   "I think we are at a great point in our project. I believe that if we tackle a lot of the solidworks and calculations of the design  we will improve."   A majority of our project work was done on an individual level. It was a large quantity of work and the quality would improve if the whole team contributed.
 Being helpful Having the ability to present information in different ways because people learn differently. Being able to receive and give positive feedback  ? Unlearn your own biases Realize when you are being biased Become better at making decisions to prevent assuming things you are biased towards Implement training to unlearn these habits as a workplace Increase curiosity    A leader must be able to: Have honesty in all situations even uncomfortable Delegate tasks to benefit and challenge the team Communicate often and efficiently to meet needs of all members and expectations Confidence in decisions and their abilities Commitment to their role and the best outcome for the team while considering input of all members Positive attitude at all times to influence team to do the best work possible Creativity in new ways to handle situations and conflict Promote self-directed learning and independence          "I have recently discovered something about myself. All through life I have been the person to turn homework in on time as much as possible  never skip a day of work if I wasnt really sick  do my fair share or more work  and I never really knew why I would feel so guilty when I missed a deadline or didnt put my best effort into what I was doing. I discovered that its because I hold myself to extremely high ethical standards. The best example would be in my co-op where I had many days on my own to lie or make wrongful decisions that I never gave into unless the client asked for it. No matter how hard that made my day or all of the extra work it meant for me  I knew how disgusting it would make me feel at the end of the day. So if I had to make a personal mission statement about ethics as I move forward through the rest of my engineering education and transition into the hardest years of my career it will be based off of all these difficult times. It goes something like this:"  "I will promise to keep ethics in the foreground of every decision that lies ahead of me  no matter how big or small  to maintain my high ethical standards for myself in all aspects such a safety and the environment."          Mindfulness is the quality or state of being conscious or aware of something. Being aware of how your actions and what you say might be perceived or what they might mean to someone around you.
 Definitely adjusting to the self-directed learning and responsibility students are allowed to have. It's so new and I appreciate it. Taking charge of my education is a great feeling.    "Practicing happiness can come from embracing the struggle  stress relievers  and compartmentalizing time in and outside of school."
This experience will better prepare me for interviews for internships and coops.  Lifelong learning means learning throughout your lifetime based off experience and then applying those experiences or knowledge gained during those experiences into a current situation.  "Self-directed learning is the driving force. This is what gives me the motivation to learn something new or keep going when I get stuck in a topic. Personal interest and ownership of what you are learning  when you are learning  how you are learning  and how much you learn is only decided on by yourself. Seeking out this learning from resources or other people is when you learn the most."  "Developing my confidence  working on maintaining a positive attitude  and stepping outside of my comfort zone more often."  "Because engineers interface with so many people it is important to know how different people might respond to what you say or do. This is related to mindfulness. Also  a design could change because of new contemporary issues such as environmental impact or sourcing parts."  "My capacity for empathy and care are at a respectable amount. If anything  I could benefit from dialing back a little bit to remain impartial in situations where I need a stronger back-bone."
﻿ "Results are very “matter of fact” pieces of information. Results should not be spoken in first person  rather third person to help convey the data to a broader audience. Finding a format that works best is completely up to you. I prefer IEEE formatted with a basic IMRD layout."  "Modeling is very important to understand the idea of how the product might function. This can mean many different methods  but usually require technical knowledge  nonetheless."  "We haven’t heard too much from our mentors and our client is technically the school. Because the director and other facilitator members are so close  it is easy to be up to date with these people. I believe we should update Christine a little more often because she is the main contact to make sure we are doing things correctly."  "I usually complete research on the problem provided  look at brainstorming ideas as potential solutions  pick the best ideas that are practical  and then documenting the solving process. This semester I changed up my process slightly from this model by involving a detailed solution."
﻿ "Overall  my technical progress is improving. I actually understand most of the topics in my advanced competencies. If I don’t understand the process or concept  I usually spend extra time making sure through experimentation. I don’t feel lost at all when it comes to my level of understanding."  "None of them are really going terrible. There is no project-based course yet  so that is one thing. We cannot figure out what can come out of this project as a competency yet. Maybe dynamic systems could be going better because I’m not too familiar with what we should be doing on a week-to-week basis"
﻿ There are flaws within our team. This includes having a poorly designed work breakdown structure. We are currently trying to make one that breaks everything down into appropriate steps.  Making a detailed work breakdown structure as well as loosen tensions that arise due to violations of our rather strict contract when it comes to time expectations.  "This estimate really depends on what we get done soon. Turbo week is coming up and we should pretty much go from 40 to about 80 percent if we do lots of work. Currently  saying we are almost at 50% is a pretty good estimate. All we need to do is keep up on the required documents."
﻿ Sweep the crowd; Always pay attention to the person speaking; Have energy and be aware of the rhetorical triangle.   "If it is something quite obvious  then simply ask yourself it would offend people in very obvious ways. It is important to note that actions usually speak louder than words. I would actively seek to simply catch myself before I commit the act."  "I hold myself to a high standard when treating other people kindly. This is my best attempt at being ethical in that sense. I tend to respect people  no matter what the case is. When it comes to engineering ethical issues  then it comes to debating whether or not I think the problem is ethical or not. The first issue I will speak about is treating others respectfully. Respect is one of my core beliefs and values  and I believe that interpersonal ethics really make a difference on all of the other ethical cases that can come up in Engineering. If you do not know how to handle people  then how can you handle the issue at hand? I am all for equal opportunity  but I am very against giving too much voice to extremist groups. I believe that having a more middle of the road approach is much better because it allows you to look at other people’s perspectives. Tensions die down if you care about the person before you care about the issue. As for common Engineering ethical problems  I am aware that they exist. One example is information about our project. We chose to do animal testing that followed procedure but did not look into every single possible group that could be contacted for information on how to do that properly. We thought that the IRB was the one in charge  but apparently there are more groups than we first thought. Personally  I think we did the right thing by researching protocol before even purchasing animals to test on. I understand the outside issues that people might face about that. The other problems that come up in Engineering simply take time to properly think about the situation from multiple angles."
﻿ "The most impactful was obtaining materials and getting a pre-prototype ready to test movement. We also received some material that will accelerate the process of culturing cells  which is very important for the final product."
﻿ I will be able to go to a real interview with true confidence and nail it on the head the first time.  Knowing about issues in the world shows that you care about society. Society is what drives the world. Engineers aim to fix the problems of society in a few ways.
﻿ "The scoping phase which realistically encompasses all steps up to planning. It is the groundwork for the project. Without scoping properly  a project will fall apart. This is why I personally prefer the V model  as it helps to place that emphasis on scope a lot more and ensures that you are constantly keeping it in mind."
﻿ "It’s hard to say. At this point so much of my time as been taken up by the project that I haven’t been spending enough time on my comps. With that said  I think everything is going to be fine."  "Probably my EMC course  it is so independent  and I haven’t been finding time to do anything."
﻿  "We have a very large team  so everything tends to take just a little bit longer because we have to spend more time communicating to ensure that we are all on the same page."  Better documentation.  I think we are on track as this point. Turbo boost we be something very helpful for the project
﻿ I don’t know.  The best way for people to work on these is to ask others to point out their unconscious biases. After they have been pointed out I need to make sure to not get defensive and actually work on them.  I need to be mindful because I am project manager. I need to be aware of what is going on and I need to be able to separate that from my own feelings about the matter so I can be as impartial as possible.
﻿ "Being on this team  hands down. Having to come up with agendas and things like that. It has really highlighted just how hard this stuff really is."
﻿ "I certainly have a newfound respect for people that are in the position  because it’s really hard."  "Contemporary issues tell us what the problems facing society are. Engineers exist to fix problems. If we are out of touch with the actual problems facing the world  we will be unable to fix them. Engineers are not scientists. We can’t do things for the sake of science  that’s not why we are here."
﻿ "Experiment results should be reported in a table format  separate from where the calculations have taken place. It is a place for someone else to look to see exactly what was found  and again there should be no confusion."  "I think that defining the problem is the most important  because the problem can often get lost in how it is communicated. This means that although a customer or client may verbalize it one way  what they want and need is something completely different because of the way I interpreted it or how they said it."
﻿ I feel that I have been doing well in keeping up with my advanced competencies this block. This is mostly due to the fact that all of the studying I have been doing for the FE is the coursework for the advanced competencies.  "The competency that is going the worst is Entrepreneurial Thinking. This is because I haven’t taken the time to watch the class videos yet but do the reading. The videos have most of the content  so I feel that I am missing a big portion of the class. I have set aside time this week to get caught up."
﻿  "I think that all of us enjoy talking to one another or people in general  so it can be hard to keep on task sometimes if we get into a conversation."  "We have gotten much better at planning  but we could still do a little bit more. Also  just setting aside more time for independent study."
﻿ Verbal Communication; Nonverbal Communication; Appearance.
﻿ "Taking the FE exam and being able to spend the last block preparing for it has been a roller coaster of an experience. Although I haven’t passed the exam yet  I never really got upset over not passing  and I think it has a lot to do with playing sports. When you play sports  you understand that you won’t win every single game  and when you should win because you put so much time into it and don’t  you realize that they are learning experiences and there is always something to improve.  So for myself  not passing the FE didn’t lower my confidence one bit. I know I’m going to pass; I just have to improve those areas in which I did the weakest."
﻿ "Since it was my last jobs package  it has really set me up to start the actual interview process. Looking back over the past 2 years and being able to go through this process 4 times  I am much more confident in being able to present myself as an engineer and that I have something to offer."
 "I think displaying date in multiple different ways that can be visualized and understood. Using pictures  graphs  and excel sheet are excellent ways to visually portray what happened and what happened. Using reports and written documents will help people to understand why it needed to be done a certain way and how it all happened to get the results."  "I believe planning a schedule or process is one of the most important steps there is to this kind of design work. Although there might be some complications  things will run so much stronger and smoother with an end goal  deadlines  and other valuable steps."  "I feel that the interaction with our client is very smooth and easygoing. They are very chill with their connections and thoughts on the project leaving there to be no added pressure on the team. We are very open and honest with the client if they needed to know anything  and the team has been able to ask questions whenever is needed with a quick and valuable response. It has been very enjoyable to work with them."  "I think the major focus for me when I go to solve an open-ended problem--I follow the design process that I have created for myself. Overall  it is a long process  but it can be broken down into four separate steps. The first of this being the problem identification which will cover the entire problem while setting up a plan to attack it. The next is to generate ideas as solutions. The next step is to pick a solution which is done by design tools. Then the validation and verification process would happen in the final design and solution phase."
 "My technical competencies took a hard start into the semester with everything being so busy and crazy as I started out  but these past two weeks  I have learned to recognize this and have sought out ways that I would be able to strengthen the outcomes of my learning and retaining of the information in these classes. With only two competencies this block  it has been helpful since the outside of school life is in its busiest time of the year. It also leaves time for my other PBL courses."  I would have to say that my only other competency that I have that I am taking (that is not an advanced competency) is Mechanics of Materials. This was a hear class for me just because the background that I had in it was taken form over a year ago. My time management for this class also was a struggle as I was so busy outside of the class itself. None of the problems that I was working on seemed to work out and nothing really made any sense to me. I have concluded that it will not come as easily to me as if I were an ME.
 I have to say that at times the team has a tendency to forget specific due dates or creations of documents or research on certain topics. This has been a struggle for all the members of the team especially me during the couple week period where I was so sick that I wasn't able to remember everything.  Time management would be this one thing that I think would be of great importance to help the team make their performance even more effective and efficient. Finding a new tool to help us stay on track by making things even more simple would be very beneficial for each of us.  "I think this is a very good place for our team to be sitting at this place in the semester. We have been working hard and made it successfully where we have wanted to be with respect to the Gantt chart and timeline. I think that one thing that we can improve for the future is intertwining the work of the female and male involvement  so there is not any slacking or anyone leaving someone out on a specific area."  "I believe each individual had a major impact on what the entire team as able to accomplish. This would mean that if one particular team member was not fully there it would require someone else to pick up their slack in order to make it become finished in time whatever the task may be. I know that there are many other impacts that an individual can have on a team dynamic  but this is just one suggestion."
 "There are so many important aspects of interpersonal communication skills that are worth each individual learning  but I have to say that the three more important ones are being able to sit back and listen with non-verbal communication skills  verbal communication skills  and being aware of the social environment that is being occupied at that moment."  "I think the first step towards minimizing or eliminating my own unconscious bias is to first become aware of when I am acting with an unconscious bias--what those situations are. Then after that  I would take the following steps to work on this. Think about the motivation behind when I say things; Figure out when I say things that are my unconscious bias and see if there is a rhythm to it. Make myself aware of the rhythm and change it; Think before I speak in all situations; Eliminate the unconscious bias"  "There are so many essential elements that should be a part of anyone who is in a leadership position  and every leader carries different ones in different ways making each leader uniquely different. One main element of a leader is the ability to work with people and guide them through interpersonal skills. I think this is one of the most important ones out of all of them  but the following elements are also essential to a leader: goal oriented  observant  patient  creative  and open-minded."  "In my personal mission statement  my goal is to strive after continuous improvements of myself and for the betterment of those around me no matter where I am at that point in life. In seeking after the betterment of myself and others  that does not mean that I will be perfect without mistakes as I go through life being that change only happens when we are outside of our comfort zones and learn from our mistakes  but it is through these experiences and situations that I will focus on making sure that my actions and thoughts are ethical to all parties involved. This also goes for those around me. I will need to be aware of the choices that others around me are making to share my opinions on projects in case they are making an unethical decision. Right now  I am still in the process of going through school and the ethical decisions aren't as major as what they will be out in industry as they will be affecting a greater amount of people  but it is the way I carry myself ethically today that matters most on who I will become tomorrow. I can start will practicing what my first thoughts are when situations that are not ethically sound or to prevent unethical thoughts from entering my mind  so they won't ever happen. Knowing that my thoughts will become my actions  this will help change my actions as well."  "I can see it as a great value you on any engineering team or in any situation. If your mind is unable to focus and can easily get distracted  it creates unsafe and nonproductive situations. This is where mindfulness comes into play as it allows you to be fully dedicated on whatever you may be working on or in any situation. There are many things that need to be considered when thinking about mindfulness  but most importantly you need to be able to let go of situations that aren't of the present and clear your mind in order to be mindful!"
 "I think there have been many different experiences that have been impactful to me over the past eight weeks. I have found anytime that I am with the team there is always something new that I learn and value. Also  the creativity session in CIOPS one day was very useful for understanding a topic that i don't really think about with greater detail. This has helped me to be more creative in my room with my project team  on my competencies  and working outside of school as well."  "I think that the best way to practice happiness at IRE is to be yourself while always seeking continuous improvement along the way. Being willing to be genuine with everything you do and not try to bluff of be fake will help with having happiness as well. This may be hard at times to be able to do  but it's the honesty that we hold ourselves to that allows us to still be able to find happiness in our rough points. Also carrying yourself with a positive attitude on a regular basis will develop a habit that will produce happiness!!!"
 I think that this will help me going into the future for job opportunities as well in everyday situations when people ask me about myself or about school or about topics that I have knowledge in. It creates a valuable resume for me to take into the future. It teaches me to have elevator speeches for all different areas of my life.  "Lifelong learning is something that I value very highly. This is what will continually help me to creative and new in all situations. If I did not learn at all or stopped learning after school  I would be the same person from that part of my life to end. This is something that industry employers are not looking to acquire in their companies. They want someone who is different than everyone else they already have at their company with new fresh ideas that will be able to make a change to their company and gain them value. Continuing to grow and develop your knowledge will help create sets of new tools that will help you be that more valuable to a company. Being able to have a growth mindset while in a company will also set you apart  since it will help you to be able to gain any knowledge that you do not have at any point in time rather than only carrying the knowledge you came into the situation with."  "I believe lifelong learning is found to be so much easier when self-directed learning is incorporated into it. When you are motivated and lots of drive to learn something  the learning becomes that much easier and the development of that knowledge is so much easier to stick in your brain  because you are the one who wanted to put it there. It was not forced there by someone else. What you put into your learning is what you will get out of it  allowing for it to go two different ways in the lifelong learning curve. By not putting any effort into the learning  it will not take you anywhere in your personal development  but if you are able to apply yourself and put a ton of effort in  there is value that will come out of it in the end."  Recognize the areas of leadership elements that have the least quality for me; Find a creative way to help develop these skills; Write an action plan that can be used in a variety of general situations; Recognize the situations that this would apply the most; Follow the action plan with S.M.A.R.T. goals to make it worthwhile; Practice them in project room and Practice them outside of school (Extracurricular activities).  "I think that it is valuable to any engineer whether in the field or in practice to have a knowledge of what contemporary issues are taking place throughout the world today. These contemporary issues affect all of us today whether we realize it or not. As the problem solvers of the world  it is our responsibility to understand the problems that we are solving as well as those that others are solving or could affect their work."  "I think this is something that I am very sensitive to for the most part. I am someone who really genuinely cares about those around me and wants to be of help at any time. I know that this may be hard for me at times when I'm stressed with my own load  but deep down I will always have the heart to feel for those around me. I have started many different groups that focus where I am to show empathy and care to the members of these groups. By creating these groups and continuing them  it is a great way to practice and make being filled with empathy and caring about others a habit."
﻿ "Results should be reported in graphs  tables  figures charts"  "Planning. Because it is through that stage you get to decide on which way to go and make major decisions on what concept to follow. Lack of planning might lead to the project not getting done or not meeting the design objective. Through the planning stage  a timeline or Gantt chart is created which helps in guiding through to ensure the project is done in time and all the requirements have been met. Without proper planning  it is hard to achieve anything."  "My personal model for open ended problem solving has changed over the years I have been at IRE. Here are the current steps I take towards solving an open ended problem: Identify the problem statement  list the constraints and make assumptions  do some research to gain understanding  brainstorm and generate ideas by designating some creativity time  listing all the options and applying the fundamental principles in the options  do cost analysis and design evaluation to select the options  and finally give the solution to the problem from the many options generated."
﻿ "At this time of the semester  my technical competencies are going great. The main motivation behind these competencies is that they are the last classes I have to take to get my bachelor’s degree. I feel like currently I am progressing on well and hope to have A in all the classes in order to keep my GPA high. Circuits class is turning on well even though I do not have a high motivation towards it. I have taken classes in the program involving circuits and having to go back and redo a prerequisite does not have a great feeling. I like the advanced classes despite the challenges we face. These are classes we take on our own without any teacher facilitating them. They are hard because we have to figure out everything by ourselves. I feel challenged also for the 2 prerequisites that I have to take currently. I have been taking block classes for the past 3 semesters and these have to run all semester long which is really challenging. However  that would not stop me from striving for best grades. I am ready to be done with school  so my efforts are all in it."  "So far  the worst competency I think is the mechatronics class. We do not even have a syllabus to follow so the teacher technically shows up to class and makes decision on what he wants us to know. It is a hard class to follow  and I don’t know what the teacher expects from me. However  on Wednesday  I understood what he was teaching mainly because I asked a lot of questions. I have had trouble understanding this teacher all through in all competencies I have taken with him. His teaching seems disorganized and unprepared to me. I am also not happy about this class because I was not aware that I needed a modeling class since I had done programming somewhere else. I later realized that the programing was used as a prerequisite hence I require a modeling class to graduate. Modelling is not what I enjoy doing. Doing it with a teacher whom I struggle to follow makes it more difficult. Don’t get me wrong! He is a very knowledgeable teacher however his delivery is somewhat off and difficult to follow. He did help me a lot last semester with my project in the programming since he has so much knowledge. But you have to listen to him keenly and be patient to understand him."
﻿ "By use of a scram chart. This shows the progress each member is making and how that is going to affect the design. Through this  every member is challenged to do their best and finish their weekly assigned tasks by the following team meeting. The team also has a team member of the week award. This is a certificate that goes to the team member that went above and beyond to stand out and do most of the project work or who helped solve an issue that had been a challenge to the team. This is a great challenge to each team member to work harder in order to get that award at the end of the week."  Have some specific people who will take a lead in creating a document and the rest would go there at their own time and do some editing. Identifying the linkages in all aspects of the design and follow them to achieve the end goal.  "According to my thoughts  the estimate is okay at the moment because we have turbo week to catch up and do more on the project work. Our team should start lining up the requirements for the prototype and start writing all the documents required. This would help the team to do more prototyping during turbo week. The chemicals for cell culture have taken longer than expected and the team should start doing the culturing process immediately; otherwise  the cells won’t grow enough for prototyping during turbo week. We should also come up with a plan B in case the cell won’t grow. Hydrogels would be a good substitute to consider."
﻿ "Verbal communication  Nonverbal communication  Written Communication"  The best way is to remind myself every time that it exists. Being self-aware can help overcome or minimize it.  "Being mindful of your actions and the surrounding is the first step to understanding other people’s needs and to being inclusive. This is of great value because  as engineers  we can hear the voice of the team members by reminding ourselves what everyone is and how to treat them. This will enable us to think before taking any action or speaking anything that can offend any team member. This can also remind us to consider other people’s feelings regardless of what we think hence provide a conducive environment for the rest of the team members to work effectively."  "My own personal mission statement in regarding to ethics is to ensure safety of the people around me and show respect to everyone regardless of who they are and where they come from. As a person  I learned to be ethical when I was growing up and as I began becoming an adult  i held onto that.  My dad always told me to respect people and show more respect to the elderly. I was taught to be aware of my own actions and how they affect people. I work with people who have mental disability and ethically  I show them the respect they need and let them make their own life decisions. I am also taught to be safe and handle myself and people around me with safety regardless of how much I can lose money. Money is not the primary reason that I am surviving. I am not into taking bribes from people to have better opportunities than other but rather enhance academic integrity and safety of the people around me. In every decision I make daily  I consider how it affects the people around me and how ethical it is. I don’t jump into deals that seem so good but rather make sure I am being respectful and considerate to other people. I try to be as honest as possible and true to myself and other people as possible. In the world we live in it is sometimes hard to be 100% honest to everything you do  but I try to reach that goal every day. One way that I have learned to be ethical is by being kind to the people I meet. For instance  if someone drops some money  I will give them back rather than keeping it. So being kind is sometimes a way of acting ethically."
﻿ "The most impactful experience I have had in the past 8 weeks is my conversation with you after the misunderstanding in the project meeting. This helped me put behind my experience I have had and getting reassurance that you really cared made me feel more comfortable and encouraged. It’s rare to find people who really care in this country.  Since that day  I have felt more accomplished and focused on the project. I still hope you understand that I have nothing against following student project manager’s guidance. Only that it depends on how someone treats me and how understanding they are on how they guide us. If someone doesn’t seem to be considerate and too pushy for no reason  I tend to pull back."
﻿ I will apply the feedback given in my future real interviews and be prepared for a throw off question. I will also find out ways to overcome stress just for my own health and future interviews in case I’d be asked.  "Contemporary issue is a big or huge thing to consider as engineers. Being aware of these issues is of great importance to all engineers in the workplace and to even non engineering team. Through understanding of these issues  we are able to make decisions and be mindful of other people’s feelings and not judge them for who we think they are. Proper training or teaching of contemporary issues will enable the society to understand better and be aware that they exist and learn to embrace them rather than tearing each other down. For instance  understanding that people of different races exist and have the ability to make a difference in this world as much as whites can is the greatest step at a workplace to consider equality and give each engineer an opportunity to exploit their potential and make a big difference in the company."
﻿ "The results should be documents in a graph if the experiment is strictly data driven. Otherwise  pictures and a written lab report are common ways to document experiments."  "There is not one step that is more important than any of the others. All of the steps in the design process are required in order to develop an effective design/solution. As you move through the design process  all steps must be addressed in order to make sure the solution is adequate."  We email the clients weekly and have been to Cirrus twice to meet with them and to collect date. We should be going there more regularly and be further along in the project than we are at this point in time. We could be having more in-depth emails and better communications with our client.  "The first step I take in developing my process for a problem is to look at the project from the outside. Understanding an overview of the situation is the best way to develop the desired outcome. The next step I take is to make sure that I identify the knowns and unknowns in the problem. After I have determined what I don’t know  I set up a plan to research on how to find the unknowns and solve the problem."
﻿ This block has been a train wreck. I think I am doing okay in Material Science and Heat Transfer and don’t know about 6 Sigma and Instrumentation. I like the more structured competencies where we have lectures and assignments that align with the previous class periods.  "I have no idea what is going on in instrumentation. We don’t have assignments  so I don’t know how to gauge my learning. There aren’t really any principles that we’ve learned so far. What I know is that we incorporate prior knowledge and apply it to new situations."
﻿ "This team is the most relaxed team I have ever been on. We are not a team of type As; this make for a less stressful project team  but also a team that might sit and turn gears for longer than necessary."  "If we set a due date to every task that is necessary for completing the project  we might be more motivated to complete project related deliverables."  "We are not the desired halfway through the project like we should be at this point. We got hung up on needing some information from our client. We haven’t done anything after we realized we needed information. As we moved through our documentation  we have also been pushing the due dates on documents off because we did not have enough information to complete the document  or we were waiting for a rubric for the document."  "A was the project manager  and I believe he led the majority of the work. He was pretty much in control of what we did and what we needed to do. We would assign parts of the project to individual team members  and power through the work. C and I are really good at following directions and doing what we are told"
﻿ Always keep an open mind; Find a similar goal; Be an effective listener.  "I need to pay more attention to my behaviors and how they affect others. If someone calls me out on my actions  I should work to correct them. I know I do not like when someone has a bias against me  so I should make sure to minimize my biases against others."  "A great leader does not actually lead at all. A great leader instead works with their team and promotes them to do a fantastic job. A leader should be poised  understanding  charismatic  honest  be confident  committed to the team and project  creative  and approachable. A good leader should also be able to assign roles and assignments to the team based on each member's strengths and willingness to participate on certain projects. A leader will not be successful if they do not know their team."  "“I will hold my family and friend’s paramount  act ethically in both my engineering work and personal life  act as an advocate for those who fall upon troubled times and are unable to stand up for themselves  and volunteer my time to help incite passion in the STEAM fields.” Each day it is my goal to make sure that I help others. I could care less how much money I make or if I were to invent something really cool  it is more important that I help others with whatever I do in my future career. Once I am done with school and have a stable career that has normal hours  I would like to be able to volunteer within my community on a regular basis. Growing up I volunteered with my church and at the hospital. I looked forward to these times because I knew that I would be helping someone  and I expected nothing in return. Volunteering at the hospital was always a wowing experience  each day was a unique journey. During my time at the hospital  I spent time volunteering in the offices  gift shop  restaurant  delivering flowers to patients  cleaning toys in the waiting rooms  volunteering in the NICU  assisting in the cancer center  and the best times ever were at the Solvay Hospice. Moving forward  I would be interested in volunteering at high schools or middle schools to help promote STEAM in our youth. My first year out of high school I volunteered with the robotics team on Wednesday nights at my old high school. I think it would be awesome to help with STEAM nights in the future  and maybe even volunteer to help with science fairs. On the less STEAM related side of my mission statement  I do believe that family and friends are more important than work or money. If a job requires me to be away from my family or does not allow for me to spend time with my friends  I will quit. There is no job that is worth missing out on making memories with the important people in my life. I would also like to be there for people who need help. I like to make myself available and approachable so that others can confide in me if need be. I am willing to pretty much talk about anything and am not afraid to stand up for others when people are talking crap about them. It is my lifelong goal to be a difference maker."  "Being mindful of my team members is something I need to focus on. A lot of the times I ask why so and so something can’t do when I seem to have enough time to  or I wonder why people do the things that they do and no other tasks. I know that everyone has different experiences and comes from a different upbringing  but I oftentimes wonder how others prioritize their life. I do not always find value in everything that I am asked to do and tend to slack off and not care about it."
﻿ "I have enjoyed Material Science and Heat Transfer; liking these classes reassured me decision to become a Mechanical Engineer. I had been debating if I should have an emphasis in Mechanical Engineering. I didn’t really like Structures so I wasn’t sure I should be an ME. I know now that I like the Thermo  Fluids  Heat Transfer type of Mechanical Engineering."  "It is important to make time for doing the things you love  and bonding with your team and classmates outside of the work environment. If you are able to find something that you and your teammates have in common  and then participating in that activity you are more likely to form bonds with them. If your teammates become your friends  you will have more successful project work."
﻿ The week after the jobs package I had a real interview and was not prepared for this at all. The interview I had I basically conducted. She did not ask me any questions and I had to fish for questions about her work experience and the company that I could possibly relate to.  "Lifelong learning means to live your life in such a way that you learn something new each and every day. Lifelong learning does not necessarily mean that you must live your life in such a way where you never leave school  but it does mean that you can teach an old dog new tricks. Lifelong learning can be achieved through research  attending conferences  trying new things  taking a class or two in something that interests you  or even just reading a book."  "Self-directed learning is important to me in the sense that I can find a topic that I would like to learn about  research it  find another person who might be an expert in that field  or someone else who is interested in it  talk about the material  and then apply it to everyday experiences. An important part of life is being able to learn something without the help of others. A great example of this would be taking music lessons as a child. I would be given a lesson book  told to look over a few sections  and then come back each week to show my teacher that I had made improvements or was struggling with certain material. I would practice with my friends outside of class to build upon our understanding of the pieces. It is always important to find a group of people that are interested in learning the same material as you are. This allows you to set goals as to what you need to do and when you need to have the material understood by."  "I try to be an extremely understanding person who is always willing to do what is best for my team. When I identify a problem  I try to find a way to solve it rather than just complaining about it. I find value in motivating my coworkers to do the best job they can. It is important to tell people when they are doing a great job and thank them for their time and efforts. When people do not feel appreciated  they will begin to perform poorly. I would like to think that the greatest leadership skill I have is compassion; I take the time to look at situations from others’ perspectives and identify what they need to succeed in the workplace."  "It is important in engineering work to analyze the impacts your design will have on the surrounding environment and know who the project will affect. Understanding contemporary issues also helps you to not seem like you live in a bubble  knowing what is going on in the world and researching how it will affect you is important to having meaningful conversations. Understanding contemporary issues also helps you to take into consideration what your peers might be experiencing and what you should be doing to help them."
 Presentations. Emails. PowerPoints. Phone calls or text messages.  Selecting a solution is my favorite part by far.  Very well. We have a great relationship with them.  I am doing the process that I came up with and am considering many different possible solutions. I will have some good solutions.
 "I feel like they are going well for the most part. Material Science with Andy is going well and so is Heat Transfer with Andy. AC with Bob is going pretty decent  but I really struggle with electricity so that makes the class more difficult. Entrepreneurial Thinking is also going well for the most part."  AC is going the worst for me. I am really struggling with it because I don't pick up on electricity stuff very quickly.
 Procrastination and talking definitely makes it harder to get things done. That is probably the worst thing we do.  Procrastination and talking makes it harder to get things done. That is probably the worst thing we do.  "We are nearing 50% but are not quite there yet. We are just getting to the testing phase which will take some time and effort  but we should be able to get there."  "We all had our parts to the project  and we all got along great which led to the team getting a lot done throughout the semester. We got all our stuff done."
﻿ Respect. Equality. Friendliness  Point them out for others for improvement.  Getting people to listen to you and to respect you. You also need to be able to get and keep people motivated.  "I set out every day to have a good time and to meet my life goals one step at a time. In doing this I also try to make sure to look out for others and make sure people aren’t doing tons of unethical things. I want people to hear my name and say oh yeah  “B is a pretty good guy”. I don’t want the reputation of somebody that nobody likes."  Being mindful helps me to make sure that I say things in a way that aren’t disrespectful or rude when I’m communicating with people.
﻿ Working well with my team and gaining some skills to use in my future and in my future project teams.  Making sure to do some fun things and not all schoolwork.
﻿ It is helping me prepare for my future.  Lifelong learning to me means that I will learn these things and know them for the rest of my life. It could also mean that I am going to be learning for the rest of my life.  A good portion of what we are learning is going to be self-directed learning. We will be learning a lot of things just as we work in industry from the experiences. We will be learning a lot of things that are required to do for the job that is at hand.  "Practice  practice  practice."  "Often  we will be working to fix contemporary issues. We have a responsibility to make sure that we do our best to fix them."  Really understanding people and being to read them.
 "Experiments should be reported in the form of an experimental report paper that includes data analysis and graphs highlighting any trends. Experimental report should be accurate  clear  and methods should  be supported by a variety of credible sources."   The validation process throughout the design process. This is important because you need to be sure you are meeting your objectives.   Our interactions are pleasant with our client although we had an incident with team members that caused some strain in the relationship because we have to go back and ask some of the same questions again.   "My model for open-ended problem solving is to first make an outline for a process  whether it is the V-model or the Design Wheel. By outlining my stages  I can plan time for creativity and track outcomes from brainstorming sessions within the context of the process."
 " I feel that I am behind. I need to outline my goals and create a task list to show evidence of my learning. I am doing better in classes that have more structure  but my PBL credit and DLAs are not where they should be at this point."   "My PBL credit and DLAs in all classes are not going well  because I have not set a distinct outline and cannot even gauge my progress. "
 Our team does not readily identify and assign specific tasks and has not used a scrum chart. Our brainstorming sessions do get off topic and the knowledge base of each team member is widely varied.    Utilizing a scrum chart and meeting with our facilitator and experts to iron out gray areas in our project.   "I think we are doing good  but we really need to finish up our modeling and confirm the points of h this week. We will be scheduling an onsite visit with faculty to identify different h points of the systems and I am looking forward to that."
 "Active Listening  Body Language  and Inclusive Communication"   ? "I think a good method to minimize this is to ask questions and be curious about other walks of life. It is important to meet someone and allow them to be an individual with their own story  to listen to hear and not just to respond."    "	Leadership is the responsibility to steer a ship in the right lane  while utilizing both conceptual and practical data to make informed decisions." "A leader must be sincere  honest  trustworthy  capable  and they must care about each person under their care and for the overall safety and success of the ship they are charged with."    "To graduate from Iron Range Engineering  as an engineer that embodies the attributes of a Difference Maker. To solve meaningful problems with lasting strategies  drawing from a strong foundation of technical understanding  entrepreneurial mindset  and effective communication strategies. To earn a leadership position by creating a positive  inclusive  and successful work environment while practicing integrity and bravery. To provide greater financial stability for myself and my family. To practice work/life/balance  practicing habits that support happy healthy living."  "My mission statement outlines my desire to be a capable and trustworthy engineer. I explicitly state that I intend to earn a leadership position by creating a positive  inclusive and successful work environment while practicing integrity and bravery. Practicing integrity can sometimes be difficult  because it is sometimes easier to just let things go to avoid conflict. This is why I included bravery in the integrity statement. Sometimes  events may take place  that although they are easier to ignore  really need to be brought to light in order for growth to take place. Speaking up and being a true difference maker requires bravery. Discernment is also an essential component to effective leadership  I might try to add a statement about developing and applying discernment to decision making  because I do not want to be a reactive leader  but one that makes calculated and insightful decisions for the betterment of society and the company I work for."  "I believe that my mission statement is a good benchmark to hold against my daily interactions with students  instructors  and family members. I do think about my mission statement when I feel worn out and would like to take short cuts. My mission statement propels me to remember what I take pride in and find most important which then guides me to go the extra mile and take care of myself so that I can be kind and take care of others."
 I believe the most impactful experience I have had was attending both the SME and SWE conferences because the conferences allow me to see beyond the daily IRE schedule and help me to align my actions with end goals.
I will be more confident and observant to finer details in the resumes of others. I am still curious on protocol concerning LinkedIn. I am dissatisfied with my page and will go over my notes from  to better improve my LinkedIn page.  "Lifelong learning means looking for opportunities for growth and understanding through ones entire life. It means never thinking  When I am done with college  I am done learning for a long time. Lifelong learning is a concept and an action verb because learning can sometimes feel uncomfortable and painful  but when one sets goals and works to achieve understanding something new to the point of being able to communicate the newfound information to someone else  the brain continues to function at a high level and is pliable to accepting new ideas."   "Self-directed learning is key to seeking and acquiring new knowledge. It is important to note that although initiative is the responsibility of the self-directed learner  seeking community and building peer relationships only strengthens our understanding of most topics."  "At times our team is rather dysfunctional. It is very tempting to want to implement carrot/stick methods such as rewards for aligning with the team directive and enforce consequences for deviant behavior. I think this is at times a misstep if there is enough value in the team and team members to move forward to a certain amount of success. Making dead end comments or stirring up past mistakes does not enable the team to move forward and at times  is very challenging to accomplish. However  I believe accepting everyone where they are at and striving to bring out their personal strengths is much better than potentially blowing the situation up just to experience temporary self-gratification."
﻿ "Experimental data and results should be written in a formal  concise manner  that is easily reviewed and skimmed. Results should be visual  and easy to read."  "Idea Generation. You need to develop a creative space to generate the best solutions. If you are nearsighted  your ideas will be limited. Find a way to think outside the box. Innovation can only happen if you are able to really be creative. This is also where being entrepreneurial is effective."  "They are going fairly well. Most emails are answered quickly  and the ones that are not are being brought up again so that we can move forward. With the exception of one Friday report  all reports to client have been on time. Face to face contact also has been going well at Cirrus."  "I believe we have had this one before  but I will repeat it. My process is designed around the design wheel. Enter the problem  define the scope  problem statement  then you define the requirements and constraints  next identify principles that will be used and make a timeline. After that it’s brainstorming  then research and pick your solution. Develop solution then verify and validate."
﻿ "I feel decent about my progress  although I don’t feel as prepared as I should. The 6-sigma course is going really well  and I am covering the items that I would like to know. I didn’t plan on taking the exam  but rather I wanted a general overview of the DMAIC process in case I have to participate in a project. My DLA’s are definitely behind schedule. I still don’t know what I am going to do for my AC DLA."  "I might say my Entrepreneurial Thinking course is probably my worst right now. Only because it’s a class with a little bit of everything. I’m not 100 percent sure on what I should know exactly for it. Although the midterm went just fine. I am way behind on the work for it though with the concept map paper. I started research on my DLA  and am working on the concept map  but the actual paper is just another paper I need to write."
﻿ "We aren’t making great progress at marching towards the goal line. The team can be easily distracted at times when working  or easily hitting roadblocks. Since this is not a traditional project  i.e.  designing some machine  the road ahead is unknown and can be discouraging."  "We are really trying to improve as a team. Communication is getting better  and the idea of what has to be done is also becoming clearer. Do I think we will achieve our goal  it’s hard to say  but the project is giving us a ton of knowledge  which in the end is about learning?"  "My thoughts are that we are not as far as we should be in regard to the end of the project. There has been good progress on current state  but the rate of progress isn’t as fast as it should be. I believe this is partly because of the lack of concrete process maps at Cirrus and them being fairly disorganized for a large company. The data spread sheet  even though sorted is still a mess to figure out their acronyms for the parts  and the SR line flow sheet through the post cure oven is nonexistent. There is a lot of work to be done  and a lot of roadblocks to overcome in 1 semester  along with the giant task of learning and implementing advanced Excel. That part alone will be an enormous undertaking. Then there are all of the papers that need to be done. It seems like all we are doing this semester is writing papers. The first step is finally overcoming the current state hurdle. We need to come together and get the current state finished  but that is getting everyone motivated for work."  "Individual contributions really helped! Most of the team made individual contributions. That was splitting the papers up and everyone taking a few. I got all my papers done  and so did R. The ones we might miss are the third person in the group. Kind of upsetting really.  I hate that R’s and my grade on papers will really suffer if the third doesn’t get his papers done today. It isn’t for lack of trying; you can only pester someone so much and the due dates have been on the board for three weeks now."
﻿ Inclusivity; Non-Confrontational; conversational tone and not being intimidating. Support role. Support the individual contributing when you are not the one who is contributing to that moment.  Simply being aware of it will help. Understanding and giving credit to other ideas and possibilities. Awareness is by far number one though  "In order of importance (to me): Accountability  dependability  the drive to succeed  people skills  management skills  a positive attitude  good sleep habits  interpersonal communication skills (the ability to interact with people above and below you)  etc."  "This is a very easy one. It doesn’t really require three paragraphs either. The simple answer is live your life with honor  while trying to be the best person you can be. I have children that watch everything that I do. They look up to me  and I try to not do anything to disappoint them. Living ethical means not stealing or cheating and working for my fair share. It’s an honor code as much as an ethical code. Work hard  earn what is mine  supply for my family  and try to make a name for myself in industry. You can only do that by being ethical in all decisions and choices in life  professional and personal."  "Well  you need to be mindful of your surroundings always  otherwise you will walk around with your head in the clouds all the time. Not being aware of what the customer wants or needs  not being mindful of your coworkers  or the business. You need to be aware of everything  all the time in order to be successful."
﻿ "I believe it is the fact that I can’t change the way my colleagues work on the team  and I can’t support the entire team myself. This happened after the first yellow sheet review (I really like that by the way  I get more out of it than just a citizenship survey). I am now backing off and letting them support themselves. Delegate the task and then assume it will get done. My only regret is the possibility of the project failing because of lack of progress."  "Smile! Get sleep  get good grades and be happy to interact with others. Don’t be a sour grape and try to remain positive in your actions. Keep your head up and keep going!"
﻿ "This is already guiding me  especially on the phone interviews that I am conducting for an internship. They have proven extremely helpful  and I value the added work on the resume. It is nice to know that my resume looks professional and has been vetted. This is probably the best piece that I will carry into the future."  "Lifelong learning is doing just what I am doing now. You are never too old to learn new things. Learning keeps the mind awake and healthy. Imagine if you were to just stop learning  how boring would life be if you knew it all and there was nothing else to discover and uncover. Pretty darned boring! So  in a nutshell  as long as you are alive  never stop learning! Pick up a book  learn a new recipe  etc."  "Essentially if we are not in a college setting  then we are self-directed learners. Nobody will have to tell me go learn about this topic  I will just do it because I am interested in knowledge. It’s the pursuit of knowledge that drives a person to succeed. What we are learning here is the ability to succeed without people guiding us. All the knowledge in the world is available for us to learn  we just must know how to access it. Self-directed learning is the key to that knowledge."  "Being a project manager for this cycle  learning all about being a manager (study)  being a leader in my career (school at the moment)  taking the initiative to get things done  and above all else  honing my people skills! A very hard one for me"  "It is very pertinent. Issues that are current will affect how your item or design is accepted. If the world is prolife and you design the world's best abortion machine  you are doomed to fail  and your reputation is ruined. The same goes the other way  you can capitalize on these issues as well. If the protesters claim they can’t be heard peacefully  and you design the world’s best microphone amplifier  marketed correctly you are a success."
 "Depending on the type of experiment you are testing  you should have some sort of graphs to go along with your data comparing the results you got to what they actually should have been. Also you should have some sort of write up on the results you recorded."   "I believe the most important step in the design process is problem definition. It is essential that you know what exactly the problem is so you have a clear idea on how to find a solution for it. If you do not understand the problem definition  how are you going to be able to move onto the next step of the process which is developing design objectives which are the constraints and requirements of the project? "    "So far interactions with our client have been going pretty good. Our client actually goes to school at IRE so if we ever have any questions  we can just go find him and ask him. He is also usually pretty good at responding to emails in a timely manner so the team doesnt have to wait for long periods of time to get a response. "

 I guess one area the team kind of struggles in is setting aside enough time each week to work on project related activities. It is hard sometimes when you have a lot of classes and homework to try and fit project work in on top of that. This is one main area the team needs to improve in order to make the project a success by the end of the semester. One way this can be improved is by working on our time management skills a little more which I will talk about in the next couple of questions. Another area that I believe affects the teams performance is lack of enthusiasm in team meetings. This was kind of addressed in the last team meeting    Use effective time management techniques. "In team meetings to help boost enthusiasm  have the person leading the meeting to stand up."   I believe that this is a pretty good estimate because the team is just getting into the idea generation phase where we are starting to looking into the different components that will be used in the new lift system. Our Gantt shows we are around 30% but it is a little off. I believe that each of the team members should each choose a component of the lift and start researching different brands of parts to find the best price and that will meet the constraints of the project.   "Each week  the team would have a meeting and establish a To Do list on the whiteboard of what needed to get done that particular week. After establishing this list  we would assign team member names to each task in which each team member was responsible for. When these tasks were completed they would be crossed off to show they were done before the end of the week. Individual contributions were distributed as evenly as possible so each team member was pulling their own weight throughout the project."
 Learn to listen Choose your words wisely  Be able to understand why communication fails  Be able to clarify   ? "	Be an agent of change. Being an agent of change means having well aligned beliefs  having the courage to appropriately act when others exhibit harmful actions  and knowing what implicit bias is  and are able to reflect on own actions or beliefs. I hope to be able to say something when at school or at my job when I get one if I see a coworker exhibiting harmful actions towards another person. I also hope to be able to talk openly with others to help them become agents of change."   Some of the essential elements I look for in a good leader are: Confidence Passionate Patient Personable Positive Accountable These are just some of many essential elements of a good leader.   "As an engineering student and when I graduate with my BSE with a Mechanical focus  I want to be a difference maker in my community ad at my job. At my job  I will be hard-working and be a positive team player. I will be inclusive towards others and treat them with respect. Maintaining a healthy work-life balance is also very important to me." "I want to be the person that makes the right decision  whether it may be trying to help  resolve a conflict on our project team  or deciding the next steps our team should take in order to complete all of our project deliverables. When trying to help resolve a conflict  I want to be the person that treats everyone equal and listens to everyones opinions whether I think they are right or not right. I dont want to hurt anyones feelings and I want to be fair to everyone. I try my hardest to treat everyone like I would want them to treat me. I dont want the decisions that I make affect anyone in a negative way." "This all sums up to a couple of words  being inclusive. I want to create an environment that is welcoming to everyone and makes them feel like they belong. I believe that everyone here at IRE should try to act this way because it makes everything go a lot smoother."   "One way to be mindful while working on a project team is when someone on the team doesnt understand a certain topic at hand. You have to be able to teach them but in the right way. Teaching with compassion means sharing your knowledge and realizing the leverage of empowering your teammates. Its not making someone feel inferior for not knowing what others may know  its giving them the patience they need to make progress. To do this  you have to strive to understand from the learners perspective."
 "Within the first couple weeks of this semester  there was Microsoft Project workshop held by the Director. This was something that was very important for me as I am the Project Manager of the project team Im on. I learned how to create a work breakdown structure and a Gantt chart in Microsoft project. I then created a WBS for the project and made a Gantt chart using that WBS. This helps the team track the project progress throughout the semester."     "In previous semesters  at IRE we have had an entire week dedicated to happiness. Throughout this week  faculty members would stop by our project rooms and give us random things to boost our positivity. Some of these random things included a stress ball with a smiley face on them and candy. I think it would be good in the future at IRE to have happiness weeks again. Throughout this week  there could be faculty and student lunches where someone grills burgers and brats or something. Having activities like these I believe help boost student positivity and happiness."
"Having five mock interview experiences and five phone interviews has prepared me greatly for when I have a real interview in the future. I have had one real interview so far for an internship last summer. I felt I did a very good job using stories and answering their questions but unfortunately  I did not receive the position. By having these mock interviews  I have had a chance to practice using many stories while answering questions. This will help me when I have a real interview because I will be prepared."  "Lifelong learning to me means continuously improving or expanding my knowledge base in all aspects of my life. At IRE  we are taught to become self-directed learners which will help me achieve lifelong learning. Lifelong learning is about creating and maintaining a positive attitude to learning both for personal and professional development." "An actual definition I found online can be seen in the following sentences. Lifelong learning is the ""ongoing  voluntary  and self-motivated"" pursuit of knowledge for either personal or professional reasons. Therefore  it not only enhances social inclusion  active citizenship  and personal development  but also self-sustainability  as well as competitiveness and employability."  "This is what self-directed learning means to me. I am the director of my own learning and the knowledge that I will gain. I will take the initiative to choose what I want to learn and how I will achieve the goals I set with or without the help from others. I am the one responsible for completing my learning. By being a self-directed learner  I will be able to teach myself new things whether it be atmy job or just anything in my everyday life. I believe that being a self-directed learner is a very important skill to have  especially for whatever job you have."  In order to further develop my leadership skills for the future there are a few steps I am currently taking which are: 1. Take a project management class in order to broaden my knowledge as to what a project manager does and certain techniques and tools they use. 2. Be the project manager/team leader of the project team I am on to get some experience. 3. Talk with faculty about the leadership class she has taught to get some advice on certain leadership styles.  "As engineers  it is important to keep up on the events  ideas  opinions  or topics in a given subject that are occurring daily throughout the world. Change is accelerating in the world and the amount of knowledge is doubling every few months which sounds crazy. With all the change that is occurring  it is important that we stay up to date with these events so that we as engineers can broaden our knowledge and be able to talk about these different issues."  "In order to further develop my capacities for empathy and care I could make a SMART goal to follow. Along with this SMART goal will be an action play to follow which is a detailed series of steps taken in order to achieve this goal. I could start out by making a goal that says throughout my career and in my everyday life  I want to help those that are struggling or having a hard time by being empathetic towards them and acting on those experiences. "
﻿ They should be reported in a logical organized way using either a technical document or a presentation to convey your findings.  "All of the steps are critical to the design process but i believe that the idea generation phase and problem solving are the most important.  I believe the fundamental principles of the design process belong in these two phases.  Defining the problem is the first step to solving the problem and starting a design.  Idea generation is also very important to the design process.  This is how a design is started and improved upon.  If there was no idea generation phase  there would be no new design or improvements on current designs."  "We do not currently have a specified client  but we have a few mentors that we use as resources. We have contacted them several times to receive feedback on technical documents or receive direction for a problematic area. In general  our contact with the mentors has been difficult. They are busy in their careers and can be hard for them to find time to schedule calls or meetings."  "I have developed a step-by-step approach to my open-ended design process. I start by defining problem and any current solutions to that problem. I then develop design objective and document any constraints or requirements. I then  for school open ended problems  relate this to any past or present learning and see if I can relate any technical knowledge. I then enter a scheduling and idea generation phase.  After ideas are generated  I start idea selection and then move into modeling and testing. I iterate between steps several times throughout the process. Documentation and research occur throughout the entire project."
﻿ I am feeling like my technical competencies are progressing well so far this semester.  I am starting to adjust to the different schedule that the self-directed learning that the classes require.  I am learning the fundamental principles of the classes and have had in-class practice with the oral exams.  I do not believe any of them are going badly but would pick entrepreneurial thinking as not going quite as well as the rest since I do not have any background for the class material.  I am not clear on the fundamental principles of the class. Although I do think that I am getting a lot out of the class.
﻿  "I believe that the only performance flaw in our tea right now is communication and finding time to meet as a team.  The reason for this is also the same reason we are performing at a high level.  We have a very large team and  as a team  find it hard to find free time in our schedule to meet and get things done quickly.  This can make small tasks difficult and also make it challenging to communicate with the entire group."  I believe we can improve by structuring our schedules so as to have more time to work on project work as a team.  This is difficult to do due to everyone having a different class schedule and having a mixture of upper division and lower division schedules.  I believe the team is on a good track to completing what we need to do by the end of the semester.  We are going to enter turbo week with a detailed mechanical drawing and all the materials we need to complete the prototype.  We can then begin to test the print head’s capabilities of printing several materials. The one thing that we can do to improve the efficiency on this project is to make a detailed plan for turbo week and finishing the technical documents.  This is currently being worked on and will hopefully be completed by the end of the week.
﻿ Learning how to disagree constructively and not start conflict.  This can be achieved by explaining your different point of view or idea. Learning to convey your ideas in a constructive manner and being able to understand other’s ideas. Strive to be a team player and acknowledge that you are willing to listen to other’s ideas.  The largest step I see to minimizing my unconscious biases include is recognizing the biases.  This includes reflecting on times that a bias may have been a contributing factor to a decision I made.  This will help me to recognize the causes of the bias and try to change my thinking or ideology of the topic.  Mindfulness is of great value to me as I work within my project team.  Giving all of your attention to a task at hand is how to be productive and achieve the maximum amount of work for a given time.  This is extremely beneficial when trying to solve a problem for the project.  Mindfulness allows you to concentrate on the problem and possible solutions.
 The most impactful experience that I have experienced was my IRE talk last week at the ethics conference.  I had to give a presentation in front of a crowd of around 200 people. This was the first time I have given a presentation in front of a crowd of that size.
 This will help to guide my future by allowing me to enter interviews with more confidence and much more experience. The jobz package also allows me to develop a bank of relevant stories I previously mentioned. This could steer my future in a huge way by possibly helping to land a good job in the future.  This is pertinent in a social and technical aspect. Engineering projects affect present day issues in several ways.  They have a large effect on the economy by creating jobs or injecting cash flows into a certain sector. They can also have a large effect on social issues. An example of this is our current project. Our current project includes several hot-topic issues such as animal testing and medical testing on humans. These are specific examples of how engineers can have a large impact on almost all issues.
 "Results should be reported honestly of course. Data in the form of graphs or charts  should accompany the results. Results should be reported even if the results do not mesh with the desired results of paying organization. "   "Again  based on above statement that reiteration is an important aspect to consider during a design process  no step is necessarily more important than the previous or next. That being said  if the problem is not accurately defined  a design will experience great difficulty in moving forward through the process."   "Overall  the interactions are going well  but at times there seems to be a great disconnect amongst the actual employees of X company with each other. Different departments seem to have different ideas of what is good for the company. There seems to be a lack of desire to get together to solve the common problem being encountered." "As far as our team  we have remained patient  and for the most part  professional in dealing with the client. We let the client know what the purpose of any meeting that we schedule with them is in advance. We have a good report with the main client contact."   "My model is based on the IRE design wheel  as well as the fundamental basis of the scientific method. It encompasses defining the problem  identifying the objectives  activating prior knowledge  identifying areas that must be learned  applying the knowledge to actual problem using engineering tools of design selection  verifying  and validating the selection through fundamental principles  re-calibrating against original problem statement  and documenting my work through citations and time gathering." Important in OPS for me is having a definite graphic that can be adjusted as areas of importance are uncovered through the process.
 " I am not at the point where I want to be. That being said  if I were at the point that I think I want to be at  I would probably still say I am not at the point I want to be. I can put it this way instead; the next three months are going to require a lot of dedicated work towards my technical competencies. The positive is that I have not been slacking off. I am over-extended at this point but over the next month  I believe that my workload will balance out considerably. I need eight technical competencies to graduate  and I am studying for FE  and 5 more at this point. In the event that I get that work done in the next three weeks  I will only have two technical competencies to complete over the last half of the semester in addition to my FE prep work."     My 2 SDL advanced comps are in need of the most improvement at this point. I have had difficulty in making time for these courses. I know what I want to learn and how to learn it. My time management is not improving at the rate at which I desire.
 "We have not completed a major milestone/benchmark to the project  and that has gotten spirits down somewhat. Our team knows that this is not because of our performance  but rather because of situations with the client that may be out of our control."    "We really need to focus our efforts on identifying the unknowns we need to complete the task we desire to complete. By identifying those unknowns  we can then be more aggressive with the client until we get all of the information that we need. We may also need to think outside the box to determine methods to acquire the data we need  through calculations or physical measurement performed by us."    "I think that this is probably a good estimate. We are slightly behind  but at the same time  have been focused on what we need to accomplish. This project has a scope that is likely out of our realm of experience  but we have done good work that is applicable." "What we can do to improve is be more organized in gaining understanding of our knowns  unknowns  and areas of expertise. When we can fully identify all of these  we can really take off and apply our knowledge to complete our portion of the project."
 "Three important aspects of interpersonal communication include self-calibration  confidence in all aspects of work and communication  and the ability to empathize with others."    ? Be aware of how what I may say can be taken out of context and offensive to individuals. Follow platinum rule.    "The essential element of leadership is having the ability to self-reflect in order to come to a realization of what one can offer in a team setting. By recognizing defects and areas of strength  one can then fully articulate these aspects to the team through open and honest communication and will be utilized by the team to full capability. In addition  going along with self-directed learning  one can also practice continuous improvement on any defects in order to be a lifetime learner  and have more to offer in future team settings or projects."    "Every day there are a variety of decisions that every person must make. These decisions range in importance and scope  but yet  ultimately shape the character of an individual." "At this point in my life  I am more aware than I have ever been in regards to the fact that my decision making has a lasting impact on the type of person that I am and desire to be. I try my best to recognize my implicit biases and reflect on them such that they may be removed from my decisions."  "I will make mistakes in my life as a student  a professional  and a human being. What is important to me at this stage is that I can recognize and admit when I make mistakes and have the self-awareness to try and correct mistakes and improve my own actions to try to limit the severity and frequency of any mistakes I am likely to make in the future."  "This is not an easy task  but I believe this path to be the one that people who are striving for growth take. I am striving for growth  so I must step out of my comfort zones when necessary regarding ethical dilemmas as they may appear in my life."
 "Being on a project with such a large scope has really tested patience  made me question my ability  and made me realize the areas that I need to improve upon  and areas that I excel in." "Facing the adversity that our team faced  and is facing  has had the biggest impact. It has made me realize the importance of communication  and the importance of knowing how I can be a leader and doing my best to hold my leadership to the highest quality. If nothing else  I can be proud to realize that I have done my best in holding up 1/x thus far."
"These experiences have made me realize that I can be calm and confident when being interviewed. Along with my previous interview experiences  I can build upon my own personal experiences to show that I am capable of undertaking any job  and that I will be a loyal employee  who is dedicated to a company that will take the chance on hiring me."  "To me  lifelong learning refers to actively identifying points of interest both work or personal  and learn by research  action  and implementation. Going along with lifelong learning is the necessary recognition that one does not ever  or will never  have all the answers. This requires a humility that will carry across personal and professional life and will allow an individual to form lasting relationships that are symbiotic in nature with work colleagues and friends." "Lifelong learning is something that is important as an engineer  because we are likely to be tasked with solving problems. In order to solve problems  one needs to have the fundamental knowledge of the cause of problems  and the knowledge of potential solutions and why those solutions would or would not suffice."  "I must always keep in mind that anything I try to accomplish in life is ultimately because of my own path to happiness. I always have choices  and in making choices  I must weigh the benefits and consequences of my learning." "That being said  my ultimate goal is to reach a place where the requirements placed upon me approach a full mesh of my personal mission statement. In this culminating point in my career  the learning should be an absolute joy for me to undertake." "If I keep this in mind when I am starting out  I can harness my goal to ensure that the learning I am doing is of value and that it will ultimately help me reach my final goal." "Reflection is an absolute important part of this phase of my development as a professional. All aspects of life are learning opportunities  and it is only my ego that says otherwise."  "I am practicing self-reflection such that I can come to realize where my strengths and weaknesses lie in order to best provide solid work in a team setting. In addition  I am continually improving both areas such that I can be the best teammate I can possibly be in any potential setting."
 "The ways that I think experiment results should be reported are in a document. This document should include figures  graphs  and tables to accurately represent the results. This document should also be ""dumbed down"" so anyone that reads it will be able to understand.  I would say that the document should be written at a level that's appropriate for the intended audience."  "I believe they are all very important steps and that no step is more important than the others. Defining the problem should have just as much value as the planning of how to go about solving that problem. Without one of these steps  the whole system would be difficult to follow along and complete successfully."  "Considering we don't really have a client  it's going great! Talking about interactions within our team  I think that is going great too. It has been an adjustment having lower division students on the team  but I think everyone is getting to know how the team flows and works together. "
 "For my core competency  material science  I feel that I am right on track with this class. I am now starting to understand it and it is very interesting to learn about the stress strain curve in more detail. For my advanced competencies  I feel that I am a little bit behind. I think this has to do with the fact that there are no IRE instructors actually teaching. We watch videos on Coursera  take notes  take quizzes  and sometimes there are assignments. I feel that I need to take an extra hour or so each week to make sure that I am on track."  "The competency that is going the worst for me right now is called Big Data. I have never heard of ""big data"" before my classmate brought it up to me. I think because I didn't have any experience in this area prior to taking the class  I felt lost right at first. This week I started to gain a better understanding of it."
 "The one thing that comes to mind is team meetings. I feel like we could be more efficient in our meetings in the sense that we spend too much time on one topic when it could be discussed in 10 minutes or so. I put some thought into this  and I feel like we could have one person take the role of keeping the meeting on task and on schedule."  Some actions that we could take to improve team's performance is to designate a person to keep the meeting on task and schedule. We could maybe schedule an upper division meeting a couple times so we can discuss topics as upper division students.  "I feel like this project team is on track. Some people may think that being only 45% done at the halfway mark of the semester is bad  but with turbo week being placed during week 10 will tremendously help this team. We will be getting a lot of work done that week. One thing that my team could improve on becoming more efficient. With having such a large team  it makes it difficult to get the ball rolling on some things."
 It is very important that everyone has a chance to speak their minds and also listen to what others have to say. Another thing that is very important is to limit those who are used to talking a lot so they can learn to summarize what they want to say in a shorter period of time instead of rambling on.  "There is some type of test out there that you can take to see what your unconscious biases are. Once you know what your biases are  then you can be aware of them and work to improve them. This is just one way that I can see being helpful in this area. Especially in the engineering field."  "Mindfulness is actually a topic that is really important to me. I always try to keep in mind that I don't know everything that may be going on in a teammate's life at the time  so I should always be respectful to them. There were times this semester where I didn't see this happening between team members  and I could tell that the negative attitudes were getting to some people. Come to find out  there were family issues going on with a team member  so the negativeness from other team members were greatly affecting that person emotionally. I always try to be mindful of people's personal lives and respect if something is going on."
 "The CIOPS that we had in the first few weeks of the semester that we talked about creativity and listened to an excerpt from an audio book about happiness. This chapter was all about how to be creative  and it was neat because it was in a book about happiness. One of the quotes from that day stick with me. ""Happiness is the key to creativity."""
 This will guide my future because it gives me the chance to practice my interview skills. This will give me a head up on other candidates in the future.  "This is important when being an engineer because it is important to know what is happening around us. The outlook of an engineer is to help the world  right? So in order to help the world  we must know what's going on in it."
 "They should be reported in the proper format. If it is numerical data  it should be in tables and graphs with detailed explanations."   The step that is the most important in my eyes is the problem definition step. The reason for this is that if you take the time to get a good problem definition this will allow you to plan out the rest of the project and makes everything that much easier later on.   The interactions are going well we have meetings as often as we can and we get good feedback every time so that we can keep moving forward.    "I guess my model starts out by looking at the problem at hand. This step can be done by either reading about the problem or talking with the client to get an idea of what they need done. The next step is to do research to see if anyone has solved a similar problem. This step also involves to some research about the problem. The third step is to brainstorm ideas after the research has been completed. The brainstorming step can take some time  the reason that I say this is that with me the way that I brainstorm the best is through procrastination. Which means that I put the problem off but the entire time I am thinking about the problem even though I am not working on it and this is how I get a lot of ideas. The fourth step is to model the ideas either through equations or computer models. The fifth step after modeling is done  we move to actual prototyping to test out the model. Which moves us into the sixth step which is to test to see if we have solved the problem or not. This step there is a lot of back and forth to see if the results compare to our model. The seventh step is to do a reality check and the last step is to finish up the problem and market the final solution. Throughout this whole process monitoring is constantly going on to make sure that I am staying on the right track and that I am staying true to what the problem needs to get completed."
  I feel that I am making decent progress in all of my comps so far in this block. I am behind in a couple of them but I think that I can get caught up fairly easily. I still have the DLAs to work on in all of my comps as well but I think that I am starting to get an idea of what I want to do for them.   The competency that is going the worst would probably be Dynamic Systems. The reason is not the subject matter of the comp. The part that I am struggling with is that we are all over the place in the class and that is making it really hard for me to follow along with what is going on.
 "There really isnt anything that anyone is doing that could be a hindrance to our team's success. Everyone is working well together  and we are able to communicate effectively during meetings and with our client."   The only action that we could take to improve our teams performance would probably be to work on our task management a little bit. This would greatly improve our efficiency on the project.   I think that this isa pretty good thing to be where we are at. We could probably be a bit farther along if there were less trips taken during the school week. The one thing that we need to do get the work done and make sure that the project gets completed is just buckle down and get the work done that we need to get done and start finishing the reports that are due a little faster so that we can get feedback on them to make them better.    Individual contributions had a pretty big impact on the completion of our project. Everyone had their own projects that they were working on and this allowed us to get more done than we probably would have otherwise.
 here are other important aspects as well. The first one is listening which can be hard for some people. Another one is written communication which is important if a team communicates by email most of the time. The last one is non-verbal communication which is probably the hardest to get because everyone will have different looks that this can be applied to.  ? One way to try to minimize your own biases is to try to get people to let you know about them if they see them. Another way is to take some tests online to see what type of biases you may have and this will help you to try and start getting rid of them.   "I think that there are multiple elements of leadership. One being that they are very reflective and always learn from their actions. Another is that they practice what they preach meaning that the do not ask anyone to do something without being willing to do it themselves. Thirdly they are very resilient  meaning that they can handle the criticism and the hardships of people not agreeing with the or trying to sabotage an idea that they have. The last two that I will mention are transparency and flexibility. It is a lot easier to get people to go along with an idea if you are transparent with them and don't hold back an ulterior motive. Being flexible is also a good thing because it means that you can roll with the punches and you are able to make choices that might not have seemed apparent before."    I guess for me my personal mission statement to make ethical decisions is to try and look at everything from all possible angles. For me personally when I do this it allows me to look at situations somewhat objectively and it also allows me the opportunity to see the situations from all sides. What I mean by all sides is that I try to take into consideration the opinions of the other side as well as anybody else that may be involved. I am by no means saying that this method is foolproof since there are always angles that I may overlook but for the most part I can get a pretty good idea of a situation before I make a decision. The decision that I make will usually be for the best but sometimes the decision that may seem right may not be the best one to make.  This leads to the second point. By trying to see situations from all the different perspectives it has led to another topic that I find very important. That is to be open minded. Since I try to make ethical decisions by understanding all of the viewpoints that go along with the issue it has made me a very open-minded person. I try to not make decisions about people or issues until I hear all of the facts from both sides. I believe that this is very important and is something that I try to constantly keep in mind as it is still something that I continually need to work on.   I think it holds value for our team because by being mindful of not just how you are doing on the team but also being mindful of everyone else around you will allow everyone to have a better overall experience. Another reason that I think that being mindful is very important for a team is that it can help the team from becoming close minded to certain solutions or ideas.
 Honestly the most impactful experience that I have had in the past 8 weeks would have to be in systems engineering. There were two things that happened in that class that were very impactful. The first one was when he had another systems engineer talk with us and we learned about what his job was like and also what it was like to be an African American Engineer. The second thing was when we had to guess things about a person based off of a picture and this was done because an Engineer that he knew was shot and killed because he was not from the US.    "Some ways to practice happiness at IRE is to try to keep a positive attitude when things are not going well  and also to laugh whenever possible. Another thing that can be done is to find something that you enjoy outside of school and do that whenever possible."
This experience really opened up my eyes and made me see that it takes all kinds of people to design something and that we all need to work together to make something happen. I will try to keep this in mind in the future and make sure that I practice this every day.  "Lifelong learning to me means that you are a reflective person. The reason that I say this is that there are things that happen to us every day that we can learn from. If you do not reflect on what happens to you then you will not learn from your mistakes or successes. It also means that you are willing to learn new things to move ahead in your career and not stagnate. When you believe that you know everything that there is to know about what you are doing  then you will no longer be successful at that job. There are always new things to learn  and you need to be willing to accept that and learn to move forward."  Self-directed learning will have a role in the fact that I am sure that there will be certain things that I need to learn for a job that I can't get in a class. This means that I will have to learn the material on my own either by talking to people that know the material well or know where to find it online and in books. It is a skill that is very important and that is taught very well here at IRE.  I am trying to be aware that there are things that I need to work on to be a good leader. Part of that is figuring out where I am lacking and work on improving that for the future. Another thing is to just stay reflective and keep my eyes open to opportunities that may come my way to work on my leadership skills.  It is pertinent because we need to be aware of the issues that are going on in the world. The reason for this is because as engineers those areas are places where we can do the most good and affect the most people.  "I think that the best way to accomplish this is to volunteer your time where it is needed. By doing this you will get to experience life from the other side  and it will make you appreciate things a little more."
 Straight to the point Easy to understand Organized Calculated compared to Experimental   Problem Definition Because you really cant move forward in a project or towards a goal if you dont know what the problem is.   "Interactions are going well  due mainly to being clear and concise in our communications with our client."   Concept Generation Scope Control Identify Fundamental Principles Develop process        Have at least two options for solutions Execute process Validate results
 Little overwhelmed at this point.    "Material Science. This class is not clicking as much  plus the class isnt as structured as heat transfer. Therefore  I am having a harder time with homework completion."
 "Really  at this point  the only hindrance our performance has towards our project is making sure everyone is on the same page and uniformly making progress in the relatively same direction. Also  there are team members who have very linear thinking (their way or the highway) and this can be detrimental to our success."   "Daily morning updates of where we are  individually  at and where we are going to try and accomplish."   "With actually solving the problem  85-90%. We are in the last stages and need only confirmation of variables and equations." "With documentation and deliverables  I would say about 35-40%. We still have many of the documents left to do and completion of our final deliverables after we solve our return condensate."
 Respect. "Being as good of a listener as you are a talker  vice versa." Knowing when you are mistaken or wrong and correcting it verbally.  ? "Privately confront individuals who are committing unconscious biases and give them constructive feedback on how they can improve. It should be a calm friendly  caring/concerned confrontation. Aggressive confrontation can make situations much worse."   Providing focus/direction Being Decisive "At the least  build/nurture a functioning team/group dynamic" Be Honest "Hold people accountable  especially yourself" "Give people sincere praise/acknowledgment for accomplishments  dont flatter" Be able to resolve conflicts    "As I pursue my career in engineering  I must always keep in mind that I have the professional obligation to be behave ethically at all times. Through constant repetition and reminders of my and my companys values I will achieve this lifelong goal." "Going forward I will make an immense effort to be ethical at all times. I will also make my decisions with everyones safety as number one priority. I will always pursue the best end for everyone and will hold all accountable  including myself."
 "The Jobs Package: The combination of resume/cover letter prep and review  phone interview  and ending with a live interview  where you also receive feedback."
The brilliant part about the jobs package is that it is performed for students every semester. There we are continuously improving and being guided towards the professional engineer we wish to be.  Lifelong learning means to me that you never let yourself be satisfied with your current level of knowledge and understanding. You must constantly strive and learn in order to keep relevant in our fast-paced world.  "The two go hand-in-hand  you cannot have a achieve lifelong learning unless you are self-directed. You must have the ambition to go out and learn. This is exactly how I will apply it with my own learning goals."
 I think that an engineering logbook is the best way. I have heard that using blue ink is preferred as well.   Scoping. Because this is where you are understanding what your problem is and what you need to know to solve it.   "There are once a week meetings that take place and we also have contact via email  text  and phone call. Id say pretty well."   I like to use the design model similar to what IRE uses. I switch up the learning objectives and call it research areas. Thats about it. I think about the problem and what constraints I have. Then I move on to researching what I need to know about the situation. I design tests and models and then I evaluate the different solutions.
  It has been pretty busy but I feel good.   "AC. I believe that my past experience with DC hasnt prepared me that well for AC. And I know that this block will be a struggle  but I am going to try my best to learn all I can."
 "There could be a little more communication is the group  sometimes I feel as if some people are reluctant to give any information or feedback to others. This hinders improvement and continuation at a faster pace from taking place  and it bothers me a little bit."   Ramping up communication and letting others know what they are doing. This will ensure that no one is doing the same work as the other members of the group.   "I would say that we are about 70% done this the project this semester. We still have to figure out the software to use CFD  but once that is figured out we will be golden."   The different levels of work ethic kept each other motivated. This was useful when it came down to the end and a lot of work was due.
 "Listening  not interrupting anyone  and providing feedback."   ? Identifying my own unconscious biases and work to be rid of them    "Being able to maintain 1/x in workload  discussion  and also having a steady knowledge base of the material so others can approach you for guidance. You also must be friendly and approachable  confident  and reliable."    Human Safety "As I make my way through my experiences at IRE I see more and more the importance of safety and making sure that people are safe. There is no value higher than the value of a life and I feel that anything created by an engineer that will developed for use should be developed with safety as the #1 priority. I wouldnt want to be responsible  and I wouldnt want anyone I work with to be responsible  and I dont want anyone to be responsible for a resulting accident or engineering failure that strips a loved one from their family and friends. This is why one part of my mission statement is to become proficient in my area of expertise  knowing very well on what is correct and what is wrong about what it is that I am working on."  Environmental Safety "My next value when it comes down to making my ethical decisions is the environment. I think about the future a lot and I dont want future generations to have to deal and live in a world that has been corrupted by decisions made today. It upsets me when I hear people say that there are no environmental issues today to worry about when now more than ever we need to be taking action in a positive direction to fix the damage that we have done to the earth. I dont want future generations to be stuck in an irreversibly damaged world  looking back saying that the people of today knew all the signs  knew what was going on  and chose to ignore the problem and not do anything about it. This is why another part of my mission statement is to make environmentally safe decisions  even if cost is an issue (because what is the cost  really  for the future)."  Inclusivity and Fairness "My last value is to ensure that everyone is treated how they want to be treated. I believe that respect  trust  and openness are the best ways to interact with people. I like to call it the little picture every single human being EVER has only lived on earth. The universe is ENORMOUS and is only getting larger. Earth is so small and it makes me upset that there are people only want one way to live and will kill over it and start wars over religion and resources. I believe that if people were more open to diversity  trusted each other  and treated each other with respect then our little planet could make huge strides in progression of the human species. That is why my personal mission statement has a part about being inclusive and open to all human beings."     "Being mindful is important because you need to be aware of what is going on within your engineering team. On the surface someone may look like they have everything under control but on the inside  they could be struggling. The same goes for external factors such as other work and even personal issues. It is good to be mindful so you treat individuals how they want to be treated."
 Being able to learn MS project was really important to me because it is a skill that I can use everywhere.    Definitely with work life balance
I know how to manage my time; I think that it is important to know what I can do and what I cant do. This means that taking time off work and volunteer hours is something I need to take into consideration.  "Lifelong learning is a value to me. It means that once you graduate and are in your work life  you are still yearning to learn more  you dont want to stop learning new things. This is important to me because in the field of engineering  things are always changing  and new systems and techniques are being developed. If you get stuck in your own time  and do not grow with the field you are in  then you will be left behind. This scares me a little bit  so I feel it is important to continue to learn after you graduate."  "My lifelong learning will be self-directed. I may take a few classes here and there  but the majority of it will be by my decisions to go out and learn new things that will be of benefit to wherever I am working. No one will be holding my hand once I graduate."  "As project manager  I am working on finding areas where the rest of my team needs help in. I know what needs to get done and when  and now I am working on pulling my weight to help us make our goals."  Staying up to date is really important. It allows you to see a need for any applications. They can also help keep you in the loop as for where engineering is headed.  "By being more involved  I feel I will naturally be better about the people and places I work for."
 "Firstly  as obvious as it sounds  I think that experiment results should not be skewed in any way from how they actually happened. It may be tempting to alter data if something doesnt make sense or if there is an outlier  but that simply voids the whole experiment and is unethical. I also think that experiment results should be quantitative when at all possible."   "I consider Scoping as well as Project / Team Monitoring to be the most important steps. Obviously all steps are important for a project to succeed. However  if the scope of work is not clearly defined  the rest of the work accomplished for the project will likely end off on a tangent and fail to solve the actual problem and meet the desired need. At the same time  if there is no Project / Team Monitoring  the work done can quickly divert and entirely miss the scope of work."   "The interactions have been going well. Our client is really easy to work with  and weve been trying our best to keep her updated weekly. It was also fun to work with her when we did the facility accessibility evaluation at IRE. Unfortunately  we have some catching up to do on the project. I hope she doesnt feel let down by our recent lack of progress."     Ill just copy/paste my actual current strategy for solving open-ended problems. 1. Decide whether it is necessary to solve problem  "2. Identify and prioritize entire scope of problem  including requirements  assumptions  and constraints" 3. Create realistic goals related to solving problem 4. Recognize fundamental principles involved in problem 5. Identify and seek relevant resources "6. Perform modeling  calculations  experiments  etc. in order to discover solution(s)" "7. Overcome obstacles with creative  critical thinking and consultation of outside resources" 8. Compare solution options with quantitative methods (E.g. Pugh Matrix) 9. Cycle back to beginning for calibration on problem scope and goals 10. Evaluate if solution(s) is satisfactory to complete problem solving process 11. Reflect on all parts of problem solving process to improve future use
 " I feel like theyre going by way too fast. Six weeks is just not enough time for an engineering course  in my honest opinion. Two more weeks  and Ill need to have my DLA done and then its time for finals. Ive made some learning in most of the classes  but it doesnt seem like nearly enough."   "Material Science. Theres enough structure and direction to the class that I can follow along  learn the fundamentals  and dive deeper into the material if I want to. Its also challenging enough to be interesting."
 "I think on the same lines as above  student and I have rubbed off each other from working together and have become more similar than we probably care to admit. I honestly consider him a brother of mine  a very good friend. Having said all that  the fact that were similar in a lot of areas can mean that we fail to look at a problem from different perspectives. Maybe the way our project turns out would be better if he and I were more different." "I dont think this is too much of an issue  though. There are worse problems to have than getting along with your teammate. "    "Thinking some more  friend and I are also fairly similar in how we get work done. Unfortunately  were both more of the hare rather than the tortoise. We get our work done  but often its in one big burst. I wish we were more methodical and more often accomplished work a little at a time."  "All of this was a nice way of saying we procrastinate. The action is that we need to get our work done piece by piece. We definitely do this  but itd be great if we could always do it! "   "Id call that a max percentage complete. I wouldnt exactly call it good because we have a lot of catching up to do. However  Im confident that we have what it takes to get our work done. The biggest thing is to come up with a detailed plan for the rest of the semester and stick to it without exception."   "This semester it seemed like peer and I predominantly worked on project tasks together. Smaller tasks like writing agendas and meeting minutes  contacting our client  and updating the Gantt Chart were done individually. The pro to this is that we were able to put our heads together when we worked together. The con is that if werent together working  hardly any project work was getting done."
 "Body language  context  barriers to effective communication. "  ? "	The biggest thing that helps is when someone points it out in my life. The reason its called unconscious bias is because its unconscious  and you dont even realize youre doing it. If I do become aware of it one way or another  I should definitely take steps and figure out if its something I need to change in my life."   "I think the most important part of leadership is having a servants heart. A leader should be of service and genuinely helpful to the people trusted in his or her care. A leader should have a vision and direction that people can believe in and follow toward success. A leader should be able to know the difference between what people want and what they actually need  and then follow through on those needs. A leader should be a role model  a motivator  a person of high integrity. There are many other values and skills that a leader ought to possess  but I will end with communication. A leader should be able to effectively communicate with his or her people. "   "Ethical decisions often happen on the fly and in a split second. There is usually not enough time to think about what choice to make and its potential consequences. Therefore  I believe its important to try to think ahead and anticipate ethical dilemmas that may occur in the future to be better prepared for them. This is easier said than done  but I believe it can be done. For example  if a vendor tries to butter you up with some free tickets or merchandise  it would be easier to decide what to do on the spot if you had already thought about what to do in a situation when youre being intentionally or unintentionally bribed. " "To put it concisely  my belief toward making ethical decisions can be summed up with a quote from Theodore Roosevelt: In any moment of decision  the best thing you can do is the right thing  the next best thing is the wrong thing  and the worst thing you can do is nothing I believe in making decisions  preferably the right ones with the best outcome. However  the future cant be predicted  and often its difficult to tell what consequences one decision may carry compared to the other. Therefore  I believe in making ethical decisions from a place of logic  compassion  and stewardship. If there is time to think before making the decision  all the better."   Mindfulness is important to any team setting because it makes teamwork much more efficient when everyone is in the here and now. Easier said than done. I know I struggled heavily with mindfulness this semester because my mind was constantly on other parts of my life for a solid two months. It was very difficult for me to focus on my project work and impacted my ability to be a productive member of the team.
 "The most impactful experience Ive had this semester would have to be dealing with personal problems while trying to focus on school and work. I went through somewhat of an emotional rollercoaster with all that was going  and it was definitely challenging. Im still struggling with a few internal things  but it has all gotten much better and I feel like a stronger person because of it."    "Going off what I said above  I have found that I feel more happy and joyful when I intentionally express gratitude daily. Ive said it before  Ill say it again. The gratitude journal has been very helpful for this. I intend to keep it up."
"The jobs package has been an invaluable experience to me the last several semesters. I put a considerable amount of time and effort into every event  and it has all been worth it. Ive seen my interview skills improve many times over. I will use what Ive learned to get hired and stay hirable  making sure that I dont become complacent  thinking that Im good enough when I reach a certain point. I will always strive to improve myself."  "As long as Im breathing  Im learning. Itd be ridiculous to think that Im done learning after formal college education. I will never  ever stop learning because there will always be new problems to solves  challenges to overcome  and curiosity to satisfy. I love learning  and Im going to do it for the rest of my life."  "I mentioned taking initiative before  and thats where self-directed learning takes place. Im not going to have a dedicated teacher to help me. Im going to have myself and my resources. Self-directed learning will help me recognize what I need to learn  follow a process to learn it  and then continue to use the new knowledge in order to retain it."  "The best leader that has ever is Jesus Christ. Since Ive learned about him  Ive been trying to learn how to be like him. When I think of the kind of leader I want to be  I think of being loving  caring  patient  kind but firm  and forgiving. If Im going to have people under my wing  I want to give them the tools they need to make themselves the best people they can be. Ive been able to learn how to do some of that at IRE by letting go of micromanaging ways and learning to give space and allow time for people (including myself!) to improve and struggle through challenges on their own to get better. Ive had opportunities to pull in my reins which Im used to holding and letting someone else have a go while I help from the sideline. I feel like thats made me a better leader  and Ive seen improved leadership qualities in the people Ive worked with when I remember to pull back."  "Engineers need to be knowledgeable about what is going on in the world around them  especially with regard to topics related to their career. For example  a civil engineer will want to keep updated on all things concrete  highway design  water infrastructure  etc."
 I think that experiment results should be reported in two ways. The first way is to collect that data and put it into different tables and graphs. This is a great way to show quantitative values from completing the experiment. The second way is to analyze the results and write a qualitative description of what the outcome was so that it looks very professional. Doing it this way allows you have to quantitative and qualitative results.   "Over my time here at Iron Range Engineering  I believe that Planning is the most important step to consider. This step lays out the entire project and allows you to determine how much time you have to complete a project as well as what tasks or objectives CAN be accomplished over the set amount of time. It is more important to take the extra time on planning a project because then you have a limited chance of encountering something unexpected that can throw the whole project off of the set timeline. I have been on a few projects where the planning was very limited and we did not end up meeting what was expected of the team."   "Mostly  we have been contacting the client when we develop questions that we need answered. One thing that we should be doing is to send updates to the client of what we are working on and making sure we are staying on the right path for the project. We plan on receiving answers to questions this week that we sent to the client two weeks ago."

 One thing that has possibly hindered team success is the enthusiasm that we have during our team meetings. This has been discussed already with the team and we have identified ways to improve this which I will talk about below. Another thing that has possibly hindered team success is not having set times for PBL learning.   "For team meetings  we have identified that the team leader for the meeting stand up and lead the meeting making the topics for the meeting more team involved and open for discussion. I think that this will bring the team success. Setting time for team PBL will allow us to ask questions that pertain to our PBL topic and allow us to advance farther in the areas we have chosen."   "The biggest thing that is going to help the project at this point is to start determining the loading profile for the new design. The first step in this is going to be to start finalizing dimensions for the new design. Once we get this done  we can then start to determine the location of the loads on the lift. Then  we can use MATLAB and use equations and variables to model our new system with the new dimensions of it. This is going to be very important step for the team over the next week of school."   This semester we had 2 seniors on the team and two first semester juniors. All of the team members completed project work. Some completed more than others. One thing that our team lacked this semester was making sure that when a due date was assigned that we made sure our tasks were completed by that date. I feel that if we had been more strict about these due dates that we may have completed a little more work.
 Make sure to have a message that you want to get across It is important to give feedback Nonverbal communication is just as important as verbal communication   ? "I do not really have a good idea of what my unconscious bias. It is hard to determine how to minimize them when I do not really know them. There is a test set forth by Harvard University that can help identify what a persons unconscious biases are. I did take one test on the area of men and women vs. career and family  and I do not have any bias towards this."   "	One essential element of leadership is that the individual has a very high level of communication skills. This is very important because when you are in a leadership position  you are going to be communicating with a bunch of people and making sure that each person is heard allows for everyone to know what is going on." "Another essential element of leadership is that an individual should have a positive attitude. The actions of a leader will reflect the actions of the people who are being led and by having a positive attitude  the leader is making an impact on the other individuals allowing more work to get completed while having fun doing it." "A third essential element of leadership is that an individual must be committed to being the leader. By being committed  you are making sure that all work gets completed and that everyone else is also committed to whatever is being worked on."    "My personal mission statement is to work hard every day of my life while being honest to myself and others. To find a job that allows me to correlate my engineering skills with my passions and hobbies. To live a happy life while maintaining a healthy relationship with family  faith  and friends. To dream big and become an inspiration to others."  "The biggest part of my mission statement that relates to making ethical decisions every day is to work hard every day of my life while being honest to myself and others. It really just comes down to being honest and making the right decision. When I find an engineering job  there is going to be times where I will have to making difficult decisions and through my experience at Iron Range Engineering and what I learned so far about ethical decision making  I know that I will make the right decision. Engineers must hold paramount the safety  health  and welfare of the public and this tells us that we need to make the right decision or there could be very severe consequences in the end."   "I looked up mindfulness and a big thing that it talks about is being aware of where we are and what we are doing  but not being overwhelmed with what is going on around us. I feel that this really relates to making sure that you are listening and know what is going on. By listening and knowing what is going on  you are aware of everything that you need to be doing. An example of this would be during Seminar on Monday mornings  listening and paying attention will allow you to know when certain things are assigned or due and that makes a person more prepared. This will transfer into my career in the future. I will always be mindful of what is going on so that I know what is going on  say a few days later. Taking notes is a great way to make sure you know what is going on and being aware."
 "The most impactful experience that I have had so far this semester is helping the two J1s on the team I am part of. They are new to Upper Division and have had plenty of questions to ask and I have been of great help to them. I feel that peer 1 has transitioned very well and has been accomplishing a lot of work for the team and himself. Peer 2 has made a good transition as well. She is starting to catch on. She does ask questions and that is a great thing. That has really helped her excel this semester for our team and herself. I am happy to help anyone that needs it. I have had some great experiences so far at IRE  and I am happy to assist anyone if they need it."     "The only times that I have experienced happiness during my IRE experience is during student life activities or when we give a final presentation to our client  and they are very excited with the solution(s) to the problem. Not many people realize how much time and effort the students of IRE put in each week. There have been many many times where I leave IRE each day exhausted and frustrated because so much is expected of us as students but there is still happiness. The best part overall that brings happiness is coming every day and seeing friends and peers."
The jobs package allows me to prepare stories to questions and that will hopefully make me stand out compared to the other interviewees. I have a lot of great experience and awards that I can show off and that will make me be remembered as well as hopefully get me hired.  "There are two major things that come to my mind when I think about lifelong learning and that is retention and continuous improvement. When I think of retention  I think about being able to recall knowledge that I have learned and understood in a very quick manner. Basically  having the knowledge right in the back of your mind and being able to apply it. Continuous improvement allows me to use my self-directed learning ability to keep progressing forward on the helix of learning in specific areas that I am working with. I will always be looking to improve  my knowledge and I am capable of doing that."  Self-directed learning allows me to learn anything that I want to learn. I have a model of how to learn about a topic and I have the capability to learn whatever I need to. Having the experience of becoming a high-level self-directed learner at IRE will allow to me to transition into a job where I have the ability to learn what I need to learn in order to fulfill the position.  I am currently the team leader for the project that I am on. I am responsible for making sure team relations are going smoothly as well as making sure the team is aware of due dates and deadlines so that our team stays on track for this project.  "As an engineer  it is important that we are aware of contemporary issues that deal with our profession. Engineering is involved in so many areas so we should know what is going on. I do like that we get emails each day from the NSPE and we can look through them and see what is going on in todays world."  I have always been a caring person. I show empathy for everyone and that is important. A good example of where you could develop empathy and care further would be to take action if you see something is wrong a person. Talk to them and see what is going on and if there is anything that you can do to help.
 I think the numerical results are best reported in data tables and graphs with strong captions to explain what the tables and graphs mean. There should also be explanations as to how you got to your findings.    "Scoping. Without a clear definition of scope and understanding of client need  success of a project is difficult to determine"   "Interactions have been going pretty well  I think. X is in charge of maintaining contact and updates with our client  but things have been slower these last couple weeks  with spring break and everything else that has been going on."   Planning Scoping Execution Evaluation Closing
 " I feel like I would like to be farther in the learning process than I currently am for my advanced competencies. I feel that this will get ramped up considerably over these next couple weeks. This semester has been very busy starting out and tech comps have been very demanding. I will be spending more time on my Advanced comps soon though. I do feel okay  because these competencies are throughout the entire semester rather than just the first block."   The competency that is going the worst would have to be instrumentation. "I can honestly say that in these first three or four weeks  I have not learned anything.      There isnt much of anything for structure in the course  so I am not too sure as to what I am supposed to learn during this comp."
 "I guess one could say that since we get along so well  our conversations could set us back in terms of productivity. We have definitely wasted some time getting way off topic over the years  but it has never kept us from completing what we sought out to accomplish. It has slowed our efficiency before."    	Coordinating our daily schedules   "I think that we could be further  but with everything that has been going on  it is what it is. I know that this next week we were kick in down and knock out a lot of work  so I am not too worried. To improve our progress  we are going to re-establish our priorities and start setting better action plans to fulfil our goals we will be setting. This will lead us into turbo week and give a strong step towards completing our project as planned. "
 Eye Contact Body Language Tailoring your presentation to the audience  ? "Using my observations of others bias to curve my actions and holding my tongue in certain situations. Also  asking those around me for possible bias that they may have noticed that I have."   Empathy Consistency Honesty Direction Communication Flexibility Conviction   "I want to be the engineer that makes a difference in their community. I plan to continue my time spent in outreach activities. I feel that some of my greatest successes have come while introducing young students to the STEM fields. Activities that help bring youth into the STEM field are a product of a forward mindset. This is that which thinks to the betterment of our world  and the way things are done. If we introduce those into STEM early  it may help them become difference makers." "Also  as a civil engineer  I need to have an ethical mindset that always keeps the well-being of the public in mind. With a project that I may have in the future  I need to work to make the world a better place  whether that is improvements with infrastructure or new innovative designs that may improve daily life of others. "   Mindfulness comes into play in many factors while working as an engineer. When it comes to being on an engineering team there are a few aspects that this many play a role in. They are as follows: 1. Keeping a persons background in mind. 2. Allowing team members to have a life/work balance. 3. Beliefs differ from person to person
 Iron Range Engineering Jobs Package "The interview process that I went through during this Jobs Package allowed me to simulate a real-life interview process with Employer. This was useful to me because I was actually going to interview with employer for a civil engineering internship. Tailoring towards my actual interview was a great experience  and I will try to line up my interviews in that manner as I move forward."
"I will continue to volunteer for the Jobs Package  as I move through my senior year at IRE. I feel that critiquing resumes and interviewing people has helped me grow in the process of being interviewed. I have seen many strong and poor interviews documents  and taken lessons from all of these since I have been a part of IRE."  "Lifelong learning is exactly as it sounds. It is that aspect that you will continue to learn throughout your life if you allow yourself to learn. If you continue to challenge yourself through your life  you will continue to learn. In these instances  you learn from failure just as much as success  and it helps you grow as an individual."   "A lot of the learning during projects and courses in school has been self-facilitated. This will continue into my career with working as a project engineering. If there are certain aspects of my project that I will need to better understand  I feel that Iron Range Engineering has prepared me to perform more effective and efficient research with the goal of learning something that I will need. This will likely be a common practice as I work through my career  especially in the beginning."  Taking on administrative and project management tasks with the current project to better my abilities. Examples of this are using microsoft project and making sure tasks are completed in the perspective timeframes using the scrum chart. Also documenting meeting and creating meeting agendas.  "It is important to know what is going on in the world around you.Example: If an individual would be working for MnDOT as an engineer and this was in the timeframe when the government shutdown  this individual would be out of work for a period a time. This could be quite the shock if they didnt understand the situation at hand.Another Example: When the I-35W bridge went down in the cities  it shook up the way bridges were inspected in all of Minnesota. What goes on in the world around you today  can dictate how things are going to be done tomorrow."
