I am glad you included more then one of your training aspects and contributions such as # of animals cages euthanasia type of rats period of exposure etc. Very nice job. I would like to recommend talking to a statistics expert (there is a statistical consulting office at NDSU) to help determine the ideal number of rats needed to have significance in your experiment if you decided to continue this project. You did discuss some methods in your video with an approximated amount but having an expert opinion never hurts. Overall nice job!

53436,4,Insert Evidence Review,12/10/2020 15:26,214,,,,no,DOK-1,,,,Me,Misconceptions with the coronary circulation. You are correct that there is a coronary artery but there are 2 branches of it which you do not highlight nor do you describe which specific chambers of the heart each branch supplies blood to. You also are also incorrect about how the blood from the coronary circulation re-enters the regular circulatory system to be re-oxygenated (it does not re-enter in the vena cava). Please review the recorded lecture from 9/15 (I believe it is around minute 38) to refresh this concept then revise your video and resubmit.

53484,4,Insert Evidence Review,12/10/2020 15:49,443,,,,no,DOK-2,,,,Group,Slide in second video does not depict what you are describing at all it merely shows information about an EKG and does not have any details about the connection you are attempting to make. I also feel this is a weak connection. After a brief search on Google for "CO2 effects on EKG" I found info of how CO2 could relate to EKG in cases of hypoventilation or hyperventilation which both effect CO2 levels in the blood as well as creates alterations in heart rhythms. I think clearer and stronger connections can be made between your project and this pillar. Please revise and resubmit.

When you are discussing your second figure you state this is representing the ventricle this is not correct. This figure is representing the arterial system. Q flowing in is coming from the left ventricle into the aorta. AoP stands for aortic pressure not ventricular pressure as you also state. The "valve" in the drawing is not an actual valve but is instead a drawn representation of the resistance of the arterioles in the system. In your third drawing (first PV loop plot) you do not discuss what the compliance values are during the cases you only mention the resistances. In your second PV loop plot you have the lines on the diagram mislabeled to the corresponding numbers you discuss (e.g. C

Conferences do not allow multiple submissions of the same abstract and if this was done one of them must be withdrawn (you cannot publish something twice). If the abstracts contained different aspects of your experiment and are focusing on differences in data collection/analysis that is okay but submitting an identical abstract is not. Abstract submissions are for DOK-4 tokens as they show your impact so please make these separate tokens. Next thank you for discussing your contributions specifically with the equation work. For DOK-3 tokens we are wanting you to apply your knowledge of a pillar and your individual work contributions to your project note that this does NOT have to be done for all the pillars just some of the pillars. Now for discussion of your pillars. FBD: since I will be reviewing based on this portion of your video I will go into detail. Your FBD portion to me was more of a connection rather than an application because you merely relate where the disease is located and do not make a clear application to the project with it. Yes there is a disease that is associated with these areas that is clear but how does this effect your contributions to the projects experimental set up? How has your understanding of the pillar benefited your PM2.5 experimental design? These are questions that if answer could push this from DOK-2 to DOK-3 for me. I really liked the connection you made in the R&C pillar you should definitely make a DOK-2 token for that.

I think (please correct if I am wrong) the heart first begins to quiver causing very erratic ECG readings with no patterns after a brief time period and if not corrected the heart then shifts into what I believe is called asystole which is when flat-lining occurs. So v-fib can lead to flat-lining and is a major cause of it but it does not immediately shift the normal heart rhythm directly into flat-lining there is a brief time period of erratic waves prior during the v-fib period.

53838,95,Insert Evidence Review,12/10/2020 19:06,630,,,,no,DOK-3,,,,Group,For APPLYING the pillar to the project I would expect some work on implementing the pillar into the project. The current evidence leans more towards DOK-2 CONNECTING ECG to your project. The added layer of looking up regulatory pathways seems to still be within the DOK-2 side of things. If you are looking to use the content that was presented in class for DOK-3 you can "consult" on something that the rest of the group APPLIED to the project. How does your the regulatory findings further APPLY ECG to the project?

I believe they HAVE addressed those prior review comments. I'm voting pass based on their personal contribution and the guidance they received in the prior review.DOK-3 requires YOU to APPLY concepts to your team project. It appears that the personal contribution to the project was the use of Bernoulli's equation to compute aperture sizes and ensure proper air flow through the enclosure.

Did you advise the team on anything which the device MUST do or MUST NOT do in order to receive FDA approval? Did you write any product requirements based on your research? DOK-3 requires an application of your work to the project.Alternatively you could show how you applied your ECG learning to the project. Did you help design any part of the ECG data collection or processing algorithms?Or you could merge your ECG learning and your FDA research. The FDA cares about patient safety. ECG is concerned with electrical signals. Did you advise your team on any hazards related to placing electronics onto a patient's body?

I believe they HAVE addressed those prior review comments. I'm voting pass based on their personal contribution and the guidance they received in the prior review. DOK-3 requires YOU to APPLY concepts to your team project. It appears that the personal contribution to the project was the use of Bernoulli's equation to compute aperture sizes and ensure proper air flow through the enclosure.  ||  	Okay there is a LOT going on in this video and I honestly am not sure what token you are wanting to submit this under because you literally touch on all of them in some way BUT since you have this labeled as an FBD DOK-3 I will be reviewing on only that portion of this video while making comments on the rest...First congrats on the abstract submission BUT I would like you to clarify if you submitted different abstracts to both RMBS and NCUR. Conferences do not allow multiple submissions of the same abstract and if this was done one of them must be withdrawn (you cannot publish something twice). If the abstracts contained different aspects of your experiment and are focusing on differences in data collection/analysis that is okay but submitting an identical abstract is not. Abstract submissions are for DOK-4 tokens as they show your impact so please make these separate tokens. Next thank you for discussing your contributions specifically with the equation work. For DOK-3 tokens we are wanting you to apply your knowledge of a pillar and your individual work contributions to your project note that this does NOT have to be done for all the pillars just some of the pillars. Now for discussion of your pillars. FBD: since I will be reviewing based on this portion of your video I will go into detail. Your FBD portion to me was more of a connection rather than an application because you merely relat|

54152,4,Insert Evidence Review,12/10/2020 20:41,627,,,,yes,DOK-2,,,,Group,Good connections to your project. I would like to highlight that when you are discussing PV loops and comparing the v-fib to "infinite resistance" that it is only partially correct. It is true that cases of v-fib and infinite resistance both have low/no blood flow into the arterial system BUT the key difference is WHY the flow of blood is low or not flowing at all. In case of infinite resistance the assumption is a healthy heart would create more pressure due to an increased resistance. In the case of v-fib the heart is not pumping blood at all (as you state in your video). So v-fib is different than the infinite resistance example because there is low/no blood flow AND low pressure.

54609,4,Insert Evidence Review,12/10/2020 23:09,528,,,,yes,DOK-2,,,,Group,Connection made to project. I would like to highlight that when you are comparing fibrillation to "infinite resistance" that it is only partially correct. It is true that cases of fibrillation and infinite resistance both have low/no blood flow into the arterial system BUT the key difference is WHY the flow of blood is low or not flowing at all. In case of infinite resistance the assumption is a healthy heart would create more pressure due to an increased resistance. In the case of fibrillation the heart is not pumping blood at all so it is different than the infinite resistance example because there is low/no blood flow AND low pressure.

You met the criteria for DOK2 reasoning (applying knowledge skills and reasoning to your project) but I would revisit the concept of diodes and how that correlates to the PV loop.Good connections to your project. I would like to highlight that when you are discussing PV loops and comparing the v-fib to "infinite resistance" that it is only partially correct. It is true that cases of v-fib and infinite resistance both have low/no blood flow into the arterial system BUT the key difference is WHY the flow of blood is low or not flowing at all. In case of infinite resistance the assumption is a healthy heart would create more pressure due to an increased resistance. In the case of v-fib the heart is not pumping blood at all (as you state in your video). So v-fib is different than the infinite resistance example because there is low/no blood flow AND low pressure.Good start: "Qin is zero AoP will drop" But then you go to the PV loop and point to the red line. This line represents the HIGHEST pressure line on the graph but you just said that AoP (Aortic Pressure) was dropping! This indicates a misunderstanding of the mathematical relationship (ohm's law for the heart). Flow ~

However there was no clear application discussed about how YOUR contributions and knowledge of the FBD was applied to your project. Near the end of your revision video you discuss how the FBD CONNECTS/relates to your project but there was not an APPLICATION discussed. You make the connection to the FBD that your sensor would be located somewhere in the systemic circulation and why you picked that region because of the CO2 levels there but this is not an application of YOUR contributions. How will the sensors you helped in finding be applied into your project design? How does your knowledge of the FBD help in determining a correct placement for these sensors - are there limitations of where the sensor can be placed due to skin thickness blood vessel depth etc.? Your contributions for the slide "Next Steps: Testing the device" would have been an excellent segway to discuss these types of things (What sort of mediums will you have to test through to mimic say a finger placement for your device?). When you discussed the slide for future testing of software implementation you could have hit on some application there as well (Will skin color have an effect on your sensor? Will body temp play a role in sensor calibrations?). These types of discussions are great applications between the placement of the sensor in the FBD and what you need to consider when testing the sensor you helped find but there was little discussion of these details in your video. Also the video of you presenting to EMBS should be created as its own token as it represents a DOK4 level to the community. Since this token is selected as being an FBD DOK3 I will be reviewing your evidence for that. To me the FBD discussion in your revision video is more of a DOK2 group level.

55070,4,Insert Evidence Review,12/11/2020 13:57,628,,,,no,DOK-3,,,,Academia,Token is for DOK-3 of the ECG pillar. Contribution was using HFSS to design an antenna. Lacks personal discussion of how these contributions along with your knowledge of ECG was useful towards project development. HOWEVER in the paper there is discussion of complications with leads for defibrillators "The most recent implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) designs utilize leads to both read electrical activity in the heart and deliver defibrillation when necessary. The problem is the leads that are inserted into the heart often need to be replaced due to infection lead fracture or displacement and a blockage of vein pathways all of which can cause major complications." and there is mention of their design being a "viable approach to leadless defibrillation"... "We do believe that this is a viable approach to leadless defibrillation but that we need to continue to adjust the design in order to meet the requirements to defibrillate." which is stated without (I assume) expert revision. My issue is I am not sure who wrote what parts of the paper...The proof of submission is an email confirmation of submission not sure if this is accepted or not yet. This one is difficult clearly there is an application between defibrillation and the project but is defibrillation close enough for being a link to the ECG pillar without detailed discussion??? Idk I would like to know other's opinions as well. I am declining it as a DOK3 ECG token specifically due to the fact that all of the application evidence (if that even counts) is in a paper that lacks information about who wrote what parts. It's a tough call though...

The connections from your project to the pillar of PV Loops/ Time Domain is solid but the misunderstanding of the material itself why this token cannot be passed.	Starling's law of the heart applies to a healthy heart being stretched a little extra. CHF involves abnormal hearts diastolic CHF has standard ESV but reduced EDV (reduced SV) systolic CHF has increased EDV and (even more) increase to ESV In both cases Stroke Volume is less than for a normal heart. "unable to keep up with extra work over a long period of time" leads to... heart palpitations? how about "leads to hypertrophy"

Starts to explain how the ejection phase changes in the time domain BUT that part of the video is confusing to me or maybe I am understanding it wrong? I would like to see other's opinions... At time 0:59 you say - "We'll be following mostly the left graph here of the pressure graph because the LVP is what's gonna be right before we see the blood in the systemic system...." I am not sure where "left" is referring to...the portion between 1 and 2 or the portion prior to 1? I believe you are attempting to answer a previous instructor comment "How will sensor readings vary over time due to the time varying behavior of the heart (and blood flow)?" and I agree there is a relationship between the ventricular pressure and its effects of how your sensor reads but your description is (to me) vague and confusing.

HFSS simulations for a defibrillator is very good work but this evidence assumes that the reviewer is going to go back and find the links of ECG to your personal contribution to your innovation.  Other reviewers have noted the same thing.  Given that we are trying to help you out with these submissions to give you credit it would have been very nice to have it laid out for us.This work is linked to ECG so a surface ECG or depending on the application a heart ECM (electro cardiogram) would have really helped your cause.  This evidence seems rushed and put together haphazardly.  So the question is what about the ECG influenced your design/HFSS thinking?

55756,95,Insert Evidence Review,12/19/2020 7:23,716,,,,no,DOK-4,,,,Society,Great work on the team. However I could not fully grasp how you used or applied FBD to your project. Yes your research is vital and important to take the idea and bring it to market. You mentioned briefly what the "business" process would be but why is this important to the group? What are the pros and cons of bringing the idea to market? What other "high impact" pathways are possible for this group? Overall the token seemed a bit too shallow for me to consider it to be a DOK-4 for this Cardiovascular Engineering course. One great way to make a deeper application and possibly a DOK-4 level token is to talk about WHY this needs FDA approval. Yes you'll be dealing with the cardiovascular system and it's easy to identify the need for "some" FDA approval but what are the specifics? What does the CP Model analyze that requires it to go through such rigorous regulation? Has there been any competitive product? Are there different types of FDA regulations for diagnostic / modeling software? Is the plan to embed the software on a chip (hardware) and if so are there additional regulations? Is this going to be used only in the hospital and clinical settings? What about the clinical trial process and regulatory pathways for clinical trials? Responses to these questions I would hope to see in a DOK-4 token from a team member who wants to focus on regulatory instead of the software/model development which is very important!
