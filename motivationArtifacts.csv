2,IRE focuses on three main areas: technical, professional, and design. Through technical, each student takes a total of 32 1-credit competencies. 16 are core knowledge while 16 are advanced. This helps give the students a breadth of fundamental knowledge. The advanced credits are chosen by the students, giving freedom to pursue the topics that interest them. Depending on the content, it can lead to a larger knowledge base or deep learning in certain subjects.
2,Professionalism includes overall preparation for the workplace. Students focus on continuous improvement with Personal Development Plans where students make goals and create plans to achieve the goals. The program also focuses on promptness, professional dress, inclusivity, and even email management. The design credits are earned through project-based learning. Each student receives a project each semester, where they work on multi-disciplinary teams to solve a problem in industry. The open-ended problems lead to self-directed learning and integrated knowledge that will be remembered for the future. Students must seek out knowledge independently and collaborate with others to complete the projects.
2,Facilitating a group or team of employees tends to be a significant responsibility, depending on the team’s abilities to be self-directed or require guidance.  In most cases, a new project will require a level of learning or research to be done to understand what needs to be done or what can be done.  Not only must the learning or research is performed individually, that knowledge gain needs to be shared among all members involved so they can understand as well.  The team is only as smart and strong as the weakest link or least informed on the team.  As engineers in profession, we are expected to be technical people and learners that can communicate our knowledge and reasoning to others, above and below our own knowledge level.  This is where collaboration comes into play and promotes idea generation and development.  Methods of facilitation can both promote or hinder collaborative learning and development based on the effectiveness of communication and sharing.  I looked for more professional examples and definitions rather than my own opinion and was highly satisfied with what I discovered.  Cornell University Center for Teaching Excellence described collaborative learning as “the view that knowledge is a social construct.”  The activities that promote collaborative learning are most often focused on four main principles; 1) the learner or student is the primary focus of instruction, 2) interaction and “doing” are of primary importance, 3) working in groups is an important mode of learning, and 4) structured approaches to developing solutions to real-world problems should be incorporated into learning.
2,The learner or student is the primary focus of instruction.  What does this mean?  I believe that Iron Range Engineering has taken a good role at identifying and incorporating this into the advanced technical credit students can achieve through the semester design projects.  Each student or team has identified topics of technical learning they want to acquire over the course of the project; however, each student is responsible for communicating the learning and information they have gathered and share it among the other team members for an overall understanding and potential idea development.  Collaborative learning usually starts with one person sharing their learning and having conversation and discussion to bounce ideas back and forth or take pieces of multiple ideas and combine them into a new approach.  Everyone thinks differently and shared ideas make the load seem less intense and visualized in an alternate perspective, leading to more ideas.  Sharing ideas gets others involved and motivates collaboration and progress development.
2,Making interaction and “doing” a primary importance among the team.  The team must interact with one another to generate valuable discussions that lead to idea refinement.  Communicating, interacting, and doing builds based on the team relations and dynamics, which in turn strengthens the abilities to collaborate with each other.  Compare two different teams, Team A and Team B.  Team A manages their time and meets deadlines for all tasks and deliverables.  Team B occasionally miss deadlines and need extensions for their reports.  Now what assumptions would you make between Team A and B?  From hypothetical research and evaluation, Team A incorporates team-wide communication into all aspects of the project.  Everyone is updated on individual tasks, completed or not, and have established an effective way of communicating when things need to be finished and submitted for review by upper management.  Team B tends to only meet 1-2 times a week for about 30 minutes.  The time is not used efficiently and communication is at below acceptable level.  No method of keeping track of deadlines is used and the same work is sometimes done by multiple people.  Now, I created two very different teams with very different attitudes and behaviors.  Team A is the wonder team, while Team B are the misfits.  Now this scenario has been exaggerated to make a point, but simple communication and getting others involved in the work motivates the others to be “doing” and adding value to the team.  It is all about working together and collaborating as a group.
2,Working in groups or together is an importance to the team’s learning.  I have discussed working and sharing with the team, but the significance of this act is typically taken lightly.  Teamwork has been and always will be the most effective way to promote creative and innovative ideas and designs.  As I mentioned before, everyone thinks differently and may be able to see the problem from another perspective you cannot or have not considered.  Teamwork is collaborative learning in a nutshell in my opinion.  Without teamwork, is there collaboration at all?  We learn by doing and from others.  Working together is promoting the “doing” aspect of collaborative learning, while the underlying understanding and new learning is taking place from the experience.  As the facilitator for my team this semester, I have tried supporting the idea of helping each other in developing the individual ideas for solving the client’s problem.  The team initially wanted to follow the path of each member being champions of their own solutions and developing them over the idea refinement period.  I proposed a simple question of “what value, if any, would you be able to acquire by approaching each concept as a team rather than individually?”  Just one question and a minute of thinking opened eyes to so much more potential.  When individuals try to make improvements to their own ideas, struggles and roadblocks tend to arise only due to their own ideas already being as developed and “right” for the solution that they fail to see the flaws or constraints.  This can lead into a structured analysis or approach being needed.
2,Structured approaches to developing solutions to real-world problems should be incorporated into the collaborative learning.  We support the practice of using an identified process at Iron Range Engineering for approaching open-ended problems.  The practice of identifying a process allows you to have a reference to always fall back on when the next steps forward become unclear.  Creating a process ensures everyone knows what is going on and can understand where the team is and what will be needing to be done in regard to solving the problem at hand.  I helped my team identify a plan and develop the plan into more detailed and specific topics for project success.  The plan or process is the famous IRE Design Wheel, and we went through the first four phases for the scoping of the project.  Here is where we collaborated in creating a list of questions to ask our clients to gain needed information about the problem we are evaluating.  After scoping, we then moved into planning and scheduling the project over the semester.  We planned for topics of learning needed to create a successful solution(s).  Through this simple yet effective step, we were able to understand that mechanical vibrations and design of experiments would be the most valued and needed information for team success.  I suggested talking to experienced and knowledgeable instructors about what topics of mechanical vibrations would apply to the project and to create a weekly plan for everyone to perform for the team’s benefit.  We spent the next week developing a Technical Learning Plan that outlined research topics and the amount of time to be dedicated towards the learning.  On top of the TLP, the team developed and have been following a project Gantt chart with the different phases or transitions within the project.  These simple yet effective practices in structuring your learning and project progression will generate motivation and outline the solution success.
2,In summary, collaborative learning is a group/team effort and must be done in all team settings.  The entire purpose is to achieve a learning goal in which leads towards a common goal of the team.  Success of one learner directly stimulates the success of other team members.  I’d like to end with one more definition of collaborative learning from the Global Development Research Center, “collaborative learning is a relationship among learners that requires positive interdependence (a sense of sink or swim together), individual accountability (each of us has to contribute and learn), interpersonal skills (communication, trust, leadership, decision-making), face-to-face promotive interaction, and processing (reflecting on how well the team is functioning and how to function even better).  This research on my own has already inspired my interest in collaborative learning and how I will continue to adapt my learning and career as an engineer.  I am going to be an entry-level engineer at my first job and will clearly be at a much lower knowledge base compared to others.
2,Collaboration is a key component of engineering. Because of this, it is no surprise that Iron Range Engineering focuses so heavily on teamwork. As a team, each member must take on individual responsibility to conquer the semester’s project. The learning within the project has such high value, and this could make project-based learning and self-directed learning common to all colleges in the future.
2,One article summed up project-based learning with five key outcomes: flexible knowledge, effective problem-solving skills, self-directed learning skills, effective collaboration skills, and intrinsic motivation. This paper focuses primarily on the self-directed learning process and comparing the roles of the student and facilitator in this process and the project as a whole.
2,Self-directed learning is an important part of the IRE program, and it is even more important later as a practicing engineer. Efficient and effective self-directed learning comes from practice. Facilitating this process is tricky business. The whole point behind self-directed learning is to do things independently, which makes facilitation seem counter intuitive.
2,The hardest step towards becoming a self-directed learner is also the first step: do it! It appears that many students put little effort into the process or take shortcuts. Facilitating the self-directed learning process should focus on this step. Other than that, a facilitator might provide guiding questions to reveal the struggles and challenges in order to correct them.
2,A big focus for semester project teams is collaboration. The students receive valuable experience working on teams and completing smaller tasks to meet a larger goal. Learning is the number one priority. Every student should understand all concepts covered over the semester.  Performing independent, self-directed research is an important skill, but the information needs to be shared. This is one challenge of a facilitator. Often times a student researches a topic, finds some key points, but does not share the important takeaways with the others. The PBL credit learning report was a huge part of the semester’s learning for the heat exchanger team for the first block. It forced students to recall the information and format it in an understandable way.
2,I can tell it is going to be a lot of work.  Not only am I the facilitator, I am the client.  I have the completion of last semester’s project work, IEEE commitments, several online classes, and IRE commitments.  It is going to be a lot of hard work but I have a stellar team and a very supportive staff as resources.
2,I can empower my team by facilitating their own learning goals.  I think taking them on tours and bringing in outside experts will give them more resources and connections.  We can also utilize the concept map.  I feel like the workshop did a good job at helping my team develop these skills, or at least showed them what it looks like.
2,The guide states constructing a knowledge base involves integrating information across multiple domains by organizing knowledge around fundamental principles. I accomplish this for myself by utilizing interleaved space retrieval and connecting new concepts to prior learning whenever possible.  It is very helpful for me to string concepts and ideas together. Online videos, practice quizzes, and workshops help expand my exposure on a subject. From here I build concept maps and do activities that deepen knowledge base.
2,A goal is an observable and measurable result that you intend to achieve or accomplish. A well-planned goal includes some sort of timeframe. It should be based on a person’s core principles and values. The domino theory of goal-setting states goals are like dominoes and a person’s pathway is defined by how she sets up her own personal dominoes. Advantages of this method of goal-setting is that it is a mindful approach which focuses on process over outcome and gain over blame. Values should be one of the predominant determinants of how we choose our goals and set up our dominoes.  It is important to establish value-centered goals because while goals may change, values are more often anchoring and consistent. I find that my values help me differentiate what is important from what is not.  When I am doing things that align with my values I experience an inexhaustible motivation and energy.
2,I think my biggest take aways are that it is not going to get any easier.  I appreciated the practical advice on how to handle inappropriate interactions.  I think her point on if it is not working for you, refocus on something that will better me.  Refocus on what is important to me and not getting validation or acceptance.  If you do the work, they can take it away from you.  If I earned an award and they never fill out the paperwork for you to receive it, you still earned the award and can keep it on your resume.  I think my instincts are, for the most part, on track.  I am trying to refocus this semester on things that will help my career and assist in my personal development.  I understand that I cannot go into interactions with most men and be emotional or they will write me off.  I have some amazingly supportive men and women at IRE. I need to focus on their support and not the negative stuff that comes up.
2,-Focus on preparation before meetings. I should form questions to ask the students instead of strictly providing information by talking. Some examples could be asking what each student has done in the past week. Also, I should always ask for a student’s opinion first before giving my own. This can limit creativity.
2,-Involve every student in meetings and focus on involvement from everyone. Every idea should be heard. I can try to give each team member their own time to talk during each meeting. This can involve whatever they want, including questions, comments, opinions, or actions.
2,-Keep a record of times where I talked too much during a meeting. During meetings, I should write down comments & opinions to other team members. This way, I can wait until they are finished talking instead of potentially interrupting. Without writing down the thoughts, I often feel like I need to interrupt ASAP before I forget the comment. After meetings, I can record if I talked too much or not. Then, I can reflect to decide what went well and what did not, and what I can change looking ahead to future meetings.
2,At midterm, I feel that I have given feedback to the best of my ability. I do not have anywhere near the experience of giving feedback that a teacher or faculty member of 10+ years, but I have some experience, and the feedback that I have gained from that experience. I usually will tell my team to seek more feedback from others after giving them feedback that they do not like to hear. The team has made a lot of good work so far this semester. They needed to reverse engineer their Sawger and they could not do that without a working product. The team is beginning to realize that the project could very easily take much more time than just the one semester. Since guiding the team is part of being a strong facilitator, I believe that I have been doing a mediocre job and that the majority of what I have done is given the team other resources to talk to that have more knowledge than I. For the rest of the semester, I want to continue to give my team my honest opinion about what they are learning. With the feedback they gain from the faculty about their project I will guide them in whatever way I can so that they reach their goals.
2,I rate myself desired (4.0) because I know I need to find motivation in my future career and wherever my next steps after high school take me, I need to stay motivated in order to be fully engaged in what I do. As motivation is what keeps me positive and makes a job enjoyable it is important that I find this right away and keep it motivating me. I think one of the first things I am going to do is start running again for fun. I did Cross Country in high school and exercise is a fantastic way to relieve stress. I have not run except for a couple of tests in the past few years and being outside exercising makes me happy.
2,As a student facilitator, I am expected to follow the expectations set by students and faculty. I need to foster self-directed learning habits, set high standards of performance, give frequent feedback, and guide the team in their project-based learning. Of these tasks, the most difficult are teaching self-directed learning techniques and habits to the students. It requires a high knowledge base to understand what self-directed learning is, even more, it requires using and understanding the skill itself to be able to teach it to others. When I initially came to Iron Range Engineering, I had some idea what self-directed learning was, I had some of the skills already but did not know it. As my education at Iron Range Engineering continued, I learned more on my own than I did in class or with an instructor. This learning that I did on my own helped me grow as a student and as an engineer. It made me the student I am today, a highly reflective, stubbornly motivated, quality oriented engineer. Throughout this process, I have worked on expressing my skills to others and talked to my team about how they can improve their self-directed learning skills. The role of the facilitator is to make sure that at all points of learning the team is doing everything they can to document their progress and learning.
2,Each person has their learning style, learns differently from the next student, and because of this, self-directed learning is different for everyone. As a facilitator, I must use this opportunity to learn my team’s personal learning style and teach them how to find the resources they need to teach themselves. In the same way that a parent must know how much freedom their child has as the child grows up, a facilitator must give freedom to their students. The team works collaboratively to express their ideas and solutions, by developing the communication skills in a small team environment the introverted individuals are more open to talking, and the extroverted are open to listening.   “A wider range of techniques is used to ensure that alternative perspectives arise, and students learn to evaluate these without the assumption that they will find the right answer. Fear is still an important characteristic of much of the group work.” What Cox and Light are getting at is the fact that as a group works and their individual voices are heard and discussed. As this happens, the mind opens ideas and questions of personal thoughts and beliefs or values related to how a different person handled a situation that they experienced together. The team succeeds together, and the team fails together. Each member reacts differently to successes and failures, how the team handles each reaction determines where the team builds and strengthens their individual skills to help the collaborative team grow and get better. These individual skills are what makes self-directed learning and continuous learning so important. These skills become better with reflection and metacognition.
2,The Facilitator Handbook gives useful tips and steps that a facilitator can use to guide the team to use metacognition and reflections to become self-directed learners. Metacognition is recognizing that you have skills that you need to learn. To learn, you set a goal. Goals are the hidden gems of learning. We make goals every day, and we make plans to reach the target. With goals, we feel a sense of accomplishment when we complete a goal, and adversely feel awful when we do not meet a goal on time. It is important that the facilitator guides this learning. The facilitator should motivate the team to accomplish their goals, and not allow the team to slack off in their deliverables and roles. The team must continue to produce a quality product, be that documents, an action plan, or a model, the team must continue to excel at what they are doing to evaluate if they have accomplished what they started at the beginning of the project. The difficulty here being motivation. How do we motivate students to want to do project work? We make it something they want to work on to reach their target goal. The more motivated the team is to accomplish goals on their project then the more likely the work is going to get done. Where this becomes difficult for my team specifically, we do not have an external customer that is expecting a particular set of documents. We have an internal client that does not want to be held back by documentation. Our client’s primary goal is to have a product that is marketable to the public. For the team to accomplish this, they have needed to build a product, test the product, verify that it works, determine if the product is worth the cost to build it, and find a company that is willing to sell the product from their store. The team has done a lot of work to accomplish these goals. The part they lack most is finding a way to document this process in a way that is meaningful to both the client and themselves as learning engineers. When I was a student on a team, I would focus my efforts on finding ways that the documents would fit the project that I was working on at the time. I would not be the one writing the papers necessarily, but I gave suggestions to the team member that was writing papers and explained how my material would relate to the project and the school. Finding the way to bridge the gap between the hated school documentation and the client’s wants and needs allowed the team to learn more out of what we did as documentation. The documents were valuable for the customer and school, and it did not cost us extra time and energy to make the documents a higher quality. The tricky part as a facilitator is reminding the team, they can do this, and not doing the process of coming up with another paper or another assignment for them. They feel like anything I am telling them to document at this point is “additional” to the school deliverables that they are behind on turning in. To change this perspective, I intend to talk to the team next week and talk specifically about documentation, professionalism and what having strong documentation skills means for your self-directed learning value.
2,In my project teams, I found the documentation process one of the most important aspects of the project. It gave me the knowledge that I needed to speak about the skills and tools that I learned and used for each project. Without writing down what skills I used and learned I would not be able to talk about them today in an interview. Some people with a better memory than I might be able to remember what they did to make decisions, but I like to be able to look back on the project and see just where I started and ended for that project. Overall, it gives me a big picture from when I started engineering to when I have finished engineering how much I have changed. I look forward to using all the skills I have learned, documentation, communication, and attention to detail being my favorites, in the future career(s) that I pursue. I have no real idea what direction I want to take with my career but starting in Duluth is all I have on my mind right now.
